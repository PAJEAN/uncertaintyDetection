While anecdotal evidence is typically disparaged as unscientific among social sciences, in the last several decades the evaluation of anecdotes has received sustained academic scrutiny from economists and scholars such as S.G. Checkland -LRB- on David Ricardo -RRB-, Steven Novella, Hollis Robbins, R. Charleton, Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, and others ; these academics seek to quantify the value inherent in the deployment of anecdotes.

In the United States, the terms ` animation director' and ` supervising animator' are sometimes used interchangeably, and in essence, they refer to the same thing. 
0.626437556385 0.701557393939 0.51 1.01409223005 32 1

As they are usually called supervising animators in the American tradition, animation directors who work in the United States will henceforth be referred to by that term. 
0.540057010038 0.42445065348 0.54 0.522435097698 29 1

However, one key difference does exist : under the classical Disney model of American animation, supervising animators directly oversee the animation of a single character.

It has also been suggested that in the ` Dolorous Passion', some passages can be read to attribute supernatural motivation for Jewish antagonism toward Christ during the crucifixion, and allege that this antipathy has intrinsic demonic grounds that pervade their very beings.

Annulment -LRB- Catholic Church -RRB- 
0.03 0.06 0.09 0.0 5 0

In the Catholic Church, ` annulment' is a canonical procedure according to the Canon Law whereby an ecclesial tribunal judges whether the bond of matrimony in a particular case was entered into invalidly -- that is, that the a true marriage according to God never took place. 
0.896856749554 0.733158356147 1.28156 0.961636732234 51 0

Annulment is not the ecclesial equivalent of a divorce.

Some accuse the Catholic Church of hypocrisy for preaching that all marriages are permanent, but providing the means of annulment. 
1.05182614143 0.36 0.57 0.582256803874 22 1

The Church reconciles these two seemingly opposing ideas by understanding that a `` Declaration of Nullity '' is not a dissolution of an existing marriage, but rather a determination that a marriage never existed. 
0.808638221555 0.55587115172 0.87 0.54769 36 0

While some may try to use an annulment to get around the `` no divorce '' rule, that is not the reason the Church has a process to declare nullity.

1.26177612893 0.3 0.45 1.56343846827 20 1

There are several responses to these criticisms. 
0.73046700974 0.135920506329 0.15 0.06 8 0

The first is that all information is neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. 
0.704451264942 0.413474559406 0.51 0.675107857143 26 0

The second is that perceptions of good and evil change -LRB- See moral panic -RRB- : If anonymous peer-to-peer networks had been around in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about civil rights or anarchism.

Over recent years BBC Two has often been accused of `` dumbing down '', and since the launch of the digital-only BBC Four, the BBC has been accused in particular of letting its more highbrow output go to the new channel, which a sizeable minority -LRB- 25.2 % in the third quarter of 2006 -RRB- of viewers still can not receive, rather than BBC Two, the perceived strategy being to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings.

In practice, brain tumors are generally considered to be malignant due to the delicate and poorly regenerative nature of neurons and restriction of the brain to the finite space of the cranium which does not allow tumor growth devoid of collateral damage to brain parenchyma.

Another cause of Err99 messages involve EF-S 18-55 lenses -LRB- kit lens for the 350D and 20D -RRB- that are defective ; purchasing used EF-S 18-55 lenses is a risk factor, especially from eBay auctions.

One major reason to use inlets is that all the inlets of a procedure are guaranteed to operate atomically with regards to each other and to the parent procedure, thus avoiding the bugs that could occur if the multiple returning procedures tried to update the same variables in the parent frame at the same time.

In quantum mechanics, due to the Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle, an electron can never be at rest ; it must always have a non-zero kinetic energy, a result not found in classical mechanics. 
0.465114646827 0.503096818182 0.96 0.792811917968 37 0

For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it can not have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can appear to be at rest, and hence appears to obey classical mechanics.

Given this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. 
0.289709149685 0.48 0.75 2.9819416214 32 0

There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories -LRB- since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization -RRB-.

0.63643818168 0.225920506329 0.18 0.332653333333 9 1

The most well-known is `` seasonal '' color analysis, which places individual coloring into four general categories : Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn.

Converse accident

This fallacy is similar to the slippery slope, where the opposition claims that if a restricted action under debate is allowed, such as allowing people with glaucoma to use medical marijuana, then the action will by stages become acceptable in general, such as eventually everyone being allowed to use marijuana. 
0.79279780889 0.903430666666 1.35 0.731108913956 55 1

0.194811772938 0.18018657754 0.39 0.18 18 0

They have been embraced and disowned with equal fervour by various metal communities, and their particular subgenre has provoked a great deal of discussion.

The band 's sound evolved from black metal to a cleaner and more `` produced '' amalgam of gothic metal, symphonic black metal and other extreme metal styles, while their lyrical themes and imagery are heavily influenced by gothic literature, poetry, mythology and horror films. 
1.76179694731 0.810407313519 1.35 1.34579246909 50 0

The band have successfully broken free of their original niche by courting mainstream publicity -LRB- often to the chagrin of its early fanbase -RRB-, and this increased accessibility has brought coverage by the likes of ` Kerrang !' and MTV, frequent main stage appearances at major festivals such as Ozzfest and Download, and in turn a more `` commercial '' image.

They have sometimes been perceived as satanic by casual observers, although their outright lyrical references to satanism are few and far between, and use of satanic imagery has arguably always had more to do with the shock value than any seriously-held beliefs.

Some modern Karaims seek to distance themselves from being identified as Jews, emphasizing what they view as their Turkic heritage and claiming that they are Turkic practitioners of a `` Mosaic religion '' separate and distinct from Judaism. 
1.45765362609 0.600190778409 0.99 1.31323082051 40 1

On the other hand, many scholars state that the phenomenon of claiming a distinct identity apart from the Jewish people appears to be no older than the nineteenth century, when it appeared under the influence of such leaders as Avraham Firkovich and Sima Babovich as a means of escaping anti-Semitism.

DualDisc 
0.03 0.0 0.0 0.0 1 0

Because the 0.9 mm thickness of the DualDisc CD layer does not conform to Red Book CD Specifications, which call for a layer no less than 1.1 mm thick, some CD players may not be able to play the CD side of a DualDisc due to a phenomenon called spherical aberration.

Electroacoustic music

Many date the formal birth of electroacoustic music to the late 1940s and early 1950s, and in particular to the work of two groups of composers whose aesthetic orientations were radically opposed. 
1.04749737907 0.666574166666 0.78 1.50103685005 34 1

The Musique concrete group was centered in Paris and was pioneered by Pierre Schaeffer ; their music was based on the juxtaposition and transformation of natural sounds -LRB- meaning real, recorded sounds, not necessarily those made by natural forces -RRB- recorded to tape or disc. 
0.562993417306 1.250155 1.29 0.666537619048 48 0

In Cologne, ` elektronische Musik', pioneered in 1949 -- 51 by the composer Herbert Eimert and the physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler, was based solely on electronically generated -LRB- synthetic -RRB- sounds, particularly sine waves -LRB- Ungeheuer 1992 -RRB-. 
0.638014580649 0.78 1.14 0.54 43 0

The precise control afforded by the studio allowed for what Eimert considered to be an electronic extension and perfection of serialism ; in the studio, serial operations could be applied to elements such as timbre and dynamics. 
1.01943098755 0.70223375174 0.99 0.246321131872 39 0

The common link between the two schools is that the music is recorded and performed through loudspeakers, without a human performer.

While serialism has been largely abandoned in electroacoustic circles, the majority of electroacoustic pieces use a combination of recorded sound and synthesized or processed sounds, and the schism between Schaeffer 's and Eimert 's approaches has been overcome, the first major example being Karlheinz Stockhausen 's ` Gesang der Jünglinge' of 1955 -- 56.

The pair is generally considered to be one of the most influential and groundbreaking groups in the history of hip hop, due to both Eric B.

Voegelin 's definition of Eschaton would be more toward the idea that Gnostics are really rejecting `` Christianity 's '' eschaton of Heaven and Hell and replacing it with a human form of salvation through revelation by mystical ritual or practice. 
0.680305846456 0.843747437314 1.11 1.22382178501 42 0

Also Voegelin attempted to clarify that gnostics had a constructive intention in their motive rather then the more destructive motive that could be derived from believing that the material world was evil and that it should be destroyed rather then repaired or improved.

At the start of the essay, Carr says that his recent difficulties with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending a lot of time on the Internet.

He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 University College London study titled `` Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future '' which suggests the emergence of new types of reading.

Carr raises the point that unlike speech, which is an innate ability hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words.

0.357718067164 0.491069350282 0.48 1.71874079033 18 0

Carr further draws on Wolf 's work, particularly her 2007 book ` Proust and the Squid', to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Alphabet-based scripts. 
0.669487494365 0.93 1.38 1.48407758809 56 0

The presence of hummocky, radar-bright crater ejecta crossing the radar-dark floor terrace and adjacent outer rim scarp suggests that the floor terrace is probably a giant rotated block that is concentric to, but lies outside of, the original crater cavity. 
2.07919730764 0.72 1.14 0.695731103216 44 1

On one hand, Qui-Gon Jinn 's school would state that the Force is biologically caused by the existence of midichlorians, hence the reliance on Anakin 's blood analysis to measure his ability with the Force. 
0.576495671474 0.69772125 0.93 2.09816366946 38 0

On the other hand, Yoda 's school, which is the dominant school in the Jedi Council, would state that the Force is purely a mystical interconnection between all things -LRB- `` Here, between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere ! Yes, even between this land and that ship ! '' he teaches Luke in ` Episode V' -RRB- and that midi-chlorians are at most a consequence of the ability with the Force, hence the reliance of the Council on true tests of Anakin 's ability with the Force, even though Qui-Gon has certified the large number of midi-chlorians in his blood. 
1.79003236606 2.49302452032 2.97192722222 2.1913687316 115 1

Yoda 's school does have some support for Midi-chlorians being merely the biological way of describing the mystical force because despite the high midi-chlorian count Anakin turned to the dark side failing in the test of mind. 
1.24103184476 0.48 0.96 0.71997879724 38 1

It is already known that Qui-Gon is a pariah among the Jedi, so it would n't be surprising if he had a slightly different view of the Force than the dominant theory.

0.969286959072 0.33 0.63 0.433511 24 1

They were never mentioned in the original trilogy, and many fans believed they diluted the spiritual aspect of ` Star Wars' by making the connection to the Force biological rather than mystical. 
1.38223459453 1.47860511361 0.84 0.941883557292 35 1

However, it may have already been established in the original trilogy that the Force was genetic -LRB- through heredity -RRB- and passed down through families. 
0.659823423838 0.443124205441 0.54 0.865266517239 27 1

Some argue that this was intentionally jarring ; a way to imply that the Jedi Order of the time had become so bureaucratic that even one 's potential in the ways of the Force was measured by a single statistic.

Indeed, it would be only after the events of ` Episode III' that one sees surviving Jedi explaining the Force in mythical terms, although Lucas insists that midi-chlorians were not mentioned in the original trilogy simply because he did not `` get around to it '' -LRB- Episode 1 commentary -RRB-.

As co-star and writer Kevin Murphy explained, Nelson was many things `` but he 's not a tinkerer '' ; the invention exchanges had in any case been vehicles for Joel to engage in the sort of prop-based comedy he had specialised in before MST3K, and Nelson 's strengths lay more in the portrayal of comic characters.

It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator 's gullibility than of the machine 's intelligence.

Natural logarithm

Initially, it might seem that since we use base 10 for nearly all calculations, this base would be more `` natural '' than base ` e', but there are several senses in which log ` e' is more `` natural ''. 
1.87058678133 0.854554754695 1.14 1.92532314286 47 1

First, throughout the natural and mathematical sciences variables appear as the exponents of ` e' in ` many' more important expressions than as exponents of 10 -- the only thing special about 10, after all, is the accident that it happens to be the number of fingers with which most humans are born. 
2.15673740558 0.797878187326 1.46142304348 1.78841091224 59 1

Thus, the natural logarithm is almost always more useful in practice. 
0.338979044849 0.102425806452 0.27 0.191198287582 13 0

As a related example, consider the problem of differentiating a logarithmic function : : \ frac -LCB- d -RCB- -LCB- dx -RCB- \ log_b -LRB- x -RRB- = \ frac -LCB- \ log_b e -RCB- -LCB- x -RCB- 
1.01371099236 0.923096818182 1.02 0.82378731383 39 0

If the base ` b' equals ` e', then the derivative is simply 1 / ` x', and at ` x' = 1 this derivative equals 1. 
0.0815126611819 0.45 0.75 0.78 34 0

Another sense in which the base - ` e' logarithm is the most natural is that it can be defined quite easily in terms of a simple integral or Taylor series and this is not true of other logarithms.

Perfluorohexane is considered biologically inert and chemically stable. 
0.634597191426 0.700408163265 0.21 0.251045 9 1

Like other fluorocarbon based liquids, perfluorohexane solubilizes gases including oxygen from the air to a higher concentration than is found in other liquids. 
0.411446255371 0.343149393876 0.6 0.624256212095 25 0

This effect is due to the nature of the fluorine atom causing low intramolecular forces between perfluorohexane molecules, which allows `` space '' for gas molecules to partition into the liquid. 
0.279500447924 0.575662002153 0.78 0.81335620852 33 0

Accordingly, there arose in some Protestant Biblical scholarship an extended use of the term ` pseudepigrapha' for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the Bibical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the Biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics.

Born in 1601, Droeshout was 14 years old when Shakespeare died, seven years before the Folio 's publication, so that he was unlikely ever to have known the playwright ; because of this, authorship doubters have questioned the circumstances behind the work, including Jonson 's assertion that the engraving was `` true to life ''.

Different types of smokeless tobacco carry different risk profiles.

However, to date, all appear to be safer than cigarettes. 
0.179947385774 0.159435928136 0.24 0.27 13 1

One thing is abundantly clear : a large body of science supports the conclusion that smokeless tobacco products of the sort used in Sweden -LRB- snus -RRB- are significantly safer than cigarettes. 
1.31762699069 0.697530143179 0.81 0.601899760979 33 1

Sweden has the lowest level of tobacco related illness in Europe, is the only country which has reduced its smoking below the WHO 's target level, and is the only EU country in which snus -LRB- a Swedish smokeless tobacco cured in such a way as to minimize the most important classes of carcinogens -RRB- is legal. 
1.72801786926 1.49437408841 1.86857142857 1.86462304348 60 0

It should be noted, also, that all data in Sweden indicates that the direction of `` movement '' of tobacco users between products is toward snus, and away from smoking, thus refuting claims that cigarette companies favor introducing snus -LRB- or other popular Western smokeless products - all of which have been documented to be safer than cigarettes -RRB- with an eye towards getting people habituated to cigarettes at a later time. 
1.95164485758 1.6777574095 1.98 1.42155315972 77 1

On the contrary, it 's very clear that cigarette companies wish to introduce smokeless products in Europe because they realize that a safer product will appeal to customers and to society in general, thus making it possible to turn a profit even as cigarette crackdowns gain momentum. 
2.06525796495 0.922317506743 1.17 1.73921606061 50 1

Luckily, the interests of the tobacco companies and of society in general intersect in this case - the availability of snus products, as has been proven in Sweden, leads to a reduction in cigarette smoking and a reduction in tobacco related illness.

However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the government of Hong Kong 's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.

Weldability 
0.03 0.0 0.0 0.0 1 0

The weldability of steels is inversely proportional to a property known as the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment. 
0.652862020343 0.455730458529 0.78 0.358029370511 29 0

The hardenability of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher hardenability and thus a lower weldability. 
0.414282542219 0.480338857143 0.78 1.09159273325 30 1

In order to be able to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel. 
1.46608968767 1.46350742545 0.99 1.85773109033 43 0

The effect on weldability of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example. 
0.687358773036 0.394081568627 0.69 0.298888515235 31 0

As the equivalent carbon content rises, the weldability of the alloy decreases. 
0.120386466647 0.305662002153 0.36 0.0653659903509 14 0

The disadvantage to using plain carbon and low-alloy steels is their lower strength-there is a trade-off between material strength and weldability. 
0.326529645815 0.51018657754 0.6 0.826991020503 22 0

High strength, low-alloy steels were developed especially for welding applications during the 1970s, and these generally easy to weld materials have good strength, making them ideal for many welding applications.
