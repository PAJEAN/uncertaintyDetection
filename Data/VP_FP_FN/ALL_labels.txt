For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it can not have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can appear to be at rest, and hence appears to obey classical mechanics.

Because the 0.9 mm thickness of the DualDisc CD layer does not conform to Red Book CD Specifications, which call for a layer no less than 1.1 mm thick, some CD players may not be able to play the CD side of a DualDisc due to a phenomenon called spherical aberration.

At the start of the essay, Carr says that his recent difficulties with concentrating while reading books and long articles may be due to spending a lot of time on the Internet.

He prefaces his argument with a couple of anecdotes from bloggers on their changing reading habits, as well as the findings of a 2008 University College London study titled `` Information Behaviour of the Researcher of the Future '' which suggests the emergence of new types of reading.

Carr raises the point that unlike speech, which is an innate ability hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words.

Carr further draws on Wolf 's work, particularly her 2007 book ` Proust and the Squid', to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Alphabet-based scripts.

On one hand, Qui-Gon Jinn 's school would state that the Force is biologically caused by the existence of midichlorians, hence the reliance on Anakin 's blood analysis to measure his ability with the Force.

On the other hand, Yoda 's school, which is the dominant school in the Jedi Council, would state that the Force is purely a mystical interconnection between all things -LRB- `` Here, between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere ! Yes, even between this land and that ship ! '' he teaches Luke in ` Episode V' -RRB- and that midi-chlorians are at most a consequence of the ability with the Force, hence the reliance of the Council on true tests of Anakin 's ability with the Force, even though Qui-Gon has certified the large number of midi-chlorians in his blood.

Yoda 's school does have some support for Midi-chlorians being merely the biological way of describing the mystical force because despite the high midi-chlorian count Anakin turned to the dark side failing in the test of mind.

It is already known that Qui-Gon is a pariah among the Jedi, so it would n't be surprising if he had a slightly different view of the Force than the dominant theory.

Some argue that this was intentionally jarring ; a way to imply that the Jedi Order of the time had become so bureaucratic that even one 's potential in the ways of the Force was measured by a single statistic.

Indeed, it would be only after the events of ` Episode III' that one sees surviving Jedi explaining the Force in mythical terms, although Lucas insists that midi-chlorians were not mentioned in the original trilogy simply because he did not `` get around to it '' -LRB- Episode 1 commentary -RRB-.

As co-star and writer Kevin Murphy explained, Nelson was many things `` but he 's not a tinkerer '' ; the invention exchanges had in any case been vehicles for Joel to engage in the sort of prop-based comedy he had specialised in before MST3K, and Nelson 's strengths lay more in the portrayal of comic characters.

First, throughout the natural and mathematical sciences variables appear as the exponents of ` e' in ` many' more important expressions than as exponents of 10 -- the only thing special about 10, after all, is the accident that it happens to be the number of fingers with which most humans are born.

Thus, the natural logarithm is almost always more useful in practice.

As a related example, consider the problem of differentiating a logarithmic function : : \ frac -LCB- d -RCB- -LCB- dx -RCB- \ log_b -LRB- x -RRB- = \ frac -LCB- \ log_b e -RCB- -LCB- x -RCB-.

If the base ` b' equals ` e', then the derivative is simply 1 / ` x', and at ` x' = 1 this derivative equals 1.

Another sense in which the base - ` e' logarithm is the most natural is that it can be defined quite easily in terms of a simple integral or Taylor series and this is not true of other logarithms.

This has led to the experimental use of perfluorohexane in treating burns victims, as their lungs can be filled with either perfluorohexane vapor or in extreme cases liquid perfluorohexane, allowing breathing to continue without the problems normally seen with pulmonary edema that sometimes occur when the inside of the lungs have been burnt e.g. by inhalation of hot smoke.

The size of the lunar tide compared to the solar tide -LRB- which comes once every 12 hours -RRB- is generally about 2 to 1, but the actual proportion along any particular shore depends on the location, orientation, and shape of the local bay or estuary.

Because ordinary tidal clocks only track a part of the tidal effect, and because the relative size of the combined effects is different in different places, they are in general only partially accurate for tracking the tides.

Sweden has the lowest level of tobacco related illness in Europe, is the only country which has reduced its smoking below the WHO 's target level, and is the only EU country in which snus -LRB- a Swedish smokeless tobacco cured in such a way as to minimize the most important classes of carcinogens -RRB- is legal.

It should be noted, also, that all data in Sweden indicates that the direction of `` movement '' of tobacco users between products is toward snus, and away from smoking, thus refuting claims that cigarette companies favor introducing snus -LRB- or other popular Western smokeless products - all of which have been documented to be safer than cigarettes -RRB- with an eye towards getting people habituated to cigarettes at a later time.

On the contrary, it 's very clear that cigarette companies wish to introduce smokeless products in Europe because they realize that a safer product will appeal to customers and to society in general, thus making it possible to turn a profit even as cigarette crackdowns gain momentum.

Luckily, the interests of the tobacco companies and of society in general intersect in this case - the availability of snus products, as has been proven in Sweden, leads to a reduction in cigarette smoking and a reduction in tobacco related illness.

Judicially, probably the most famous example of a tracing claim is ` AG for Hong Kong v Reid' -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 AC 324, -LSB- 1994 -RSB- 1 NZLR 1 -LRB- PC -RRB-, where Mr Reid, then the Solicitor General for Hong Kong, received bribes for passing information to organised crime in Hong Kong.

When he was caught, Mr Reid admitted that the money was subject to a constructive trust, but argued that he should only be liable to repay the amount of the bribes, and then any profit attributable to the increase in value of the land in New Zealand was not connected with his wrongdoing.

However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the government of Hong Kong 's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.

Some atheists argue that believing in the possibility of a God is as ridiculous as believing in the possibility of Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, and so forth, and find it contradictory that weak agnostics believe in the possibility of the former but not any of the latter.

To a weak agnostic the concepts of Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Christian God, and so forth, are clearly defined claims akin to claiming the existence of alien life on a specific planet in our solar system, whereas the general concept of God is more akin to the concept of alien life anywhere in the universe.

The weldability of steels is inversely proportional to a property known as the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment.

The hardenability of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher hardenability and thus a lower weldability.

In order to be able to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel.
