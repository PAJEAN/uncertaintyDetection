It was very clear that development of IL-17-producing T cells was not dependent on the cytokines and the transcription factors required for Th1 or Th2 differentiation and then it was proposed that IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells represented a new subset of helper T cells -LRB- Th17 cells -RRB-, which were crucial in mediating inflammatory responses -LRB- 30-32 -RRB-. 
1.12259953131 1.47572529516 1.6362 1.34088707101 61 8.94095430619 6.85402269358 

While there was evidence that IL-23 stimulated CD4 + T cells to express various genes, including IL-17, and that IL-23-stimulated T cells were important in the pathogenesis of EAE -LRB- 30 -RRB-, it was less clear whether IL-23 was the factor that drove naive CD4 + T cells to become IL-17 producers.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms of Stat3-mediated expression of RORγt are still unclear. 
1.18187247282 0.360532807549 0.3636 1.85385207447 15 3.6926339419 2.76704603 

Even so, RORγt could be a good candidate to target in treating inflammatory diseases -LRB- discussed in further detail below -RRB-. 
0.368574978127 0.517328116002 0.5454 1.30292809524 23 2.67007513678 4.07112666667 

RORα seems to synergize with RORγt to promote development of Th17 lineage -LRB- 47 -RRB-. 
0.686185419028 0.3333 0.4242 0.251345 16 2.96464924351 0.62427 

However, how IFN-γ and IL-4 inhibit IL-17 production is not yet known. 
0.381467276431 0.509201103208 0.803455 0.602957142857 14 2.46818868523 2.99466142857 

These reports suggest a cross-regulatory relationship among Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation. 
1.11329815068 0.303 0.3939 0.789055976191 15 2.804661732 1.33258080952 

However, it still remains to be determined how Th1-related and Th2-related transcription factors negatively regulate IL-17 production. 
0.347114301388 0.752290928136 1.33329 2.4867315368 19 3.64935447156 5.23822348485 

The mechanism by which Tregs preserve peripheral tolerance is still not entirely clear ; however, they preferentially express cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 -LRB- CTLA-4 -RRB-, and immunosuppressive cytokines including TGFß-1 and IL-10 -LRB- 55-57 -RRB-. 
0.59005689668 0.802121807549 0.9696 0.614354357184 38 5.83821043902 5.07453148342 

This putative relationship also led to investigation of the importance of IL-2 in Th17 differentiation -LRB- 44 -RRB-. 
0.217111564881 0.398962002153 0.4242 0.301731115251 19 2.5378294966 1.84288275523 

Furthermore, blockade of IL-2 or deletion of Stat5 promoted Th17 differentiation, suggesting that IL-2 inhibited Th17 lineage by affecting the RORγt-Foxp3 balance -LRB- 44 -RRB-. 
1.15001293329 0.6666 0.7575 0.437130195122 28 3.96735038326 3.69527692683 

Therefore, helper T cells seem to have a unique way of achieving a balance between Tregs and Th17 cells during ongoing immune responses. 
0.62722125449 0.4848 0.606 0.991163828625 25 3.09486318172 2.74196431374 

Interestingly, Foxp3 may inhibit RORγt activity on its target genes, at least in par, t through direct interaction with RORγt -LRB- 63 -RRB-. 
0.361295111778 0.585431142857 0.6969 0.700165093023 27 1.4686995663 2.65864248837 

Paradoxically, IL-6 and TGFß-1 seem to drive initial Th17 lineage commitment but also restrain the pathogenic potential of Th17 cells by producing IL-10 also -LRB- 34 -RRB-. 
0.826068986455 0.6363 0.8181 0.438844308123 29 4.31542043115 3.55725512864 

As such, their relevance may vary among different autoimmune diseases.

TGFß-1 seems to have dual effects on human Th17 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. 
0.543928396539 0.2424 0.3333 0.0526193738 15 2.93160586589 0.598725736277 

Of these latter cytokines, IL-23 seems to be the most effective -LRB- 10, 66, 72, 73 -RRB-. 
0.908089372669 0.854130703083 0.727268043478 0.996074371429 22 3.16918386788 3.37978192857 

Purified naive CD4 + T cells from HIES individuals can not differentiate into Th17 cells in vitro and have lower expression of RORγt -LRB- 46 -RRB-, suggesting that Stat3 signaling is also a crucial factor for the generation of human Th17 cells. 
1.46296049217 1.03426125229 1.189598125 1.43307735612 44 7.09157553256 7.35404063868 

Although Th17 cells are important and essential subsets participating in host defense against extracellular antigens, evidence implicating Th17 cells as a causal factor of autoimmune diseases is also mounting -LRB- 25 -RRB-. 
0.848587446855 0.793666451613 0.9696 0.82747932264 34 5.04865850373 5.52024168692 

This being said, there is little evidence of T cell proliferation in RA and we still do not know for certain the cellular source of IL-17 in RA synovium -LRB- 88 -RRB-. 
1.6545197009 1.42707407997 1.97144666667 1.40755146825 34 7.34641197179 5.37903307936 

Therefore, anti-IL-17 therapy may become an alternative for treating patients unresponsive to conventional anti-TNF therapy. 
0.420279514183 0.303 0.4545 0.219863040293 17 1.96552310015 2.59822711538 

It still remains to be seen whether blocking IL-17 will affect other proinflammatory cytokines for example IL-6, IL-1, and IL-22 in RA patients. 
0.928722805728 1.07556269456 1.63629 1.25189371032 26 5.27137490448 3.97245464286 

To what extent their efficacy relates to inhibition of IL-17 will be important to ascertain. 
0.426579557413 0.2424 0.3636 0.450061777777 16 2.97016755924 2.601196 

Although IL-1 has been reported to contribute to Th17 differentiation in mouse and man, it remains to be determined whether therapeutic targeting of IL-1 will substantially affect IL-17 in RA. 
1.1063471391 2.42175142939 3.20006 1.32764657012 32 6.43877763888 5.04926292683 

There is no doubt that IL-17 and the other proinflammatory cytokines are likely to be relevant therapeutic targets in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases. 
1.4359494466 0.640772231378 0.624628387097 4.06584858019 26 6.1059684127 7.72115347949 

Protein levels of nuclear AID are tightly controlled, as unregulated expression can lead to alterations in the immune response.

We therefore suggest that estrogen-induced autoimmunity and oncogenesis may be derived through AID-dependent DNA instability. 
1.09389285735 0.393422311558 0.3939 0.22290987013 16 2.69925086371 1.03319806818 

Furthermore, SHM, by way of AID, may contribute to lymphomagenesis by mutating -LRB- proto - -RRB- oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, or by promoting chromosomal translocations -LRB- 12 -- 14 -RRB-. 
0.56867795037 0.6363 0.9393 0.659318 36 4.15330663448 5.36629685714 

Outside the immune system, there are indications that systemic hyperexpression of AID can induce non -- B cell cancers from lung -LRB- 20 -RRB-, lymphatic -LRB- 20 -RRB-, and liver -LRB- 21 -RRB- tissues.

AID has also been implicated as a developmental epigenetic reprogramming factor, and its expression levels in oocytes is almost equivalent to that in lymph nodes -LRB- 22 -RRB-, suggesting that AID could be regulated by pathways other than B cell activation pathways -LRB- e.g., E-box proteins -LSB- 23 -RSB-, NF-κB -LSB- 24 -RSB-, and Pax5 -LSB- 25 -RSB- -RRB-, with hormones being plausible candidates.

Estrogen and its biological and synthetic derivatives are thought to be oncogenic for breast and ovarian tissue -LRB- 32, 33 -RRB-, most often being associated with their growth-promoting and differentiating capacity.

Our data indicate that the mutagenic DNA deaminases are potentially an important target for hormonal regulation.

This was done to avoid a possible maximal induction of LPS/IL -4 caused by longer treatment.

This antithetical effect of estrogen and progesterone indicated that AID gene regulation is embedded within a systemic sex hormone pathway. 
0.195893739835 0.496518 0.5757 0.348108987488 21 2.69403876119 1.76518229651 

Because we could determine that the expression of gene regulated in breast cancer 1 -LRB- a known estrogen response gene -RRB- -LRB- 36 -RRB- had a similar stimulation profile in B cells -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-, it seemed likely that the AID gene could also be activated in uninduced B cells with estrogen.

In most systems, the synthetic hormone Tam acts as an antagonist to estrogen stimulation, presumably by binding to the estrogen receptor -LRB- ER -RRB- and altering its DNA binding capacity -LRB- 37 -RRB-.

Although we were able to observe an increase in AID mRNA at 2 h -LRB- Fig. 1 -RRB-, we needed to determine if this regulation was direct or indirect. 
0.22686713859 0.562766666667 0.7575 0.43713250874 31 3.28445836357 3.87680895704 

This suggested that the effect of estrogen was directly mediated on AID 's mRNA synthesis.

Because qRT-PCR of cDNA is a readout of steady-state mRNA, we also tested if the increase by estrogen was caused by transcription or mRNA metabolism. 
0.456902662693 0.54558657754 0.7272 0.356292489569 27 4.26782419464 1.60595974917 

Treatment of cells with transcription inhibitors -LRB- actinomycin D -LSB- ACT -RSB- and α-amanitin -LSB- AMA -RSB- -RRB- abrogated the effect of estrogen, indicating that this alteration in AID 's mRNA was not caused by message stability -LRB- Fig. S1 B -RRB-. 
0.445363541586 0.924425810811 1.2423 0.727619546051 45 5.40972920771 5.52926102227 

The rapid effect of the hormones on AID message via transcription suggested that the AID gene is a direct target for hormonal regulation.

The potential response regions were placed into a luciferase reporter construct and transfected into human SiHa cells, followed by treatment with the indicated hormone -LRB- or cotransfected with expression plasmids -RRB-, and then analyzed for luciferase activity.

As we were primarily interested in the effect of hormones on expression, we used relative change as a readout rather than absolute values, which provided a more direct evaluation of the hormone treatment but potentially obscured the individual effect of the various DNA elements. 
0.686210651787 0.854654929306 1.1817 1.49715786613 47 5.0144321513 5.89572091016 

When compared with DMSO treatment, estrogen responsiveness was most significant with Fragment C, indicating that this contained the predominant estrogen-responsive DNA element.

As indicated by the qRT-PCR analysis in Fig. 1 A, estrogen and the LPS/IL -4 -- induced NF-κB stress-response pathway could act synergistically on AID mRNA production.

This indicated that in the AID promoter, the NF-κB site and its proximal ERE could act independently as well as synergistically. 
0.358458778569 0.833755 0.5757 0.250298125 23 3.64144568578 2.27198125 

The transient transfection assay indicated that a predicted ERE was subject to estrogen regulation.

Cotreatment with estrogen and TNF-α had the same effect as estrogen alone -LRB- Fig. 3 B, lane 5 -RRB-, indicating that the two pathways act through different nuclear proteins. 
0.4797317279 0.612537619048 0.7575 1.70505526918 32 2.71577446494 6.11161031792 

The anti-ERα antibody did induce the appearance of a high molecular weight complex -LRB- Fig. 3 C, triangle in lanes 4 and 5 -RRB-, which could be caused by either the supershift of a dimerized ERα or heterodimer ERα / ERß ; however, this needs to be analyzed further. 
0.546263550969 0.920768148416 1.212 0.901690756678 53 6.68538611718 6.68214856185 

Because estrogen and TNF-α co-stimulation did not alter ER binding to the ERE, we wanted to determine if the reciprocal of NF-κB binding to the NF-κB site, after the combined treatment, was also unaffected. 
0.540766526523 0.901957468562 1.0302 0.244796289636 38 4.80866591984 2.52419614619 

Although the in vitro binding of the ER to the AID promoter indicated a direct binding, we also wanted to probe this interaction in vivo. 
0.0982036798599 0.429262002153 0.7575 0.416635527273 27 2.26939281799 3.55977847273 

For us to determine if the effect of estrogen on AID would also extend to the protein level, we developed a quantitative approach for measuring AID protein. 
0.849953299579 0.532466666667 0.7878 0.234713570504 29 3.41712115647 2.56185316101 

On the molecular level, CSR requires AID, yet regulation can be achieved on multiple levels, some of which may be hormonally influenced. 
1.1400614817 1.38133899058 0.940236666666 1.02524511022 26 3.33480736904 4.43778900298 

To ensure we could correlate AID activity precisely, and to avoid possible proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of estrogen on stimulated B cells, we monitored the early molecular events of class switching. 
0.470150887778 0.6666 0.9393 1.25332859921 34 2.90598793937 5.35948313492 

Presumably through the increased production of AID, estrogen was able to enhance switch circle formation for all subclasses tested. 
0.85164548349 0.2727 0.5151 0.303 21 3.32725373431 2.8696 

In each experiment, 2 spleens per sample were treated with or without 50 nM estrogen in the presence of LPS for 72 h.

The effect of aberrant AID targeting can lead to somatic mutations or even translocations of protooncogenes or tumor suppressors, and subsequently to oncogenesis -LRB- 16 -RRB-.

To determine if the activity of hormones via AID can also lead to an alteration in non-Ig loci, we chose to look at the proapoptotic tumor suppressor CD95/Fas. 
0.329758755327 0.593135123043 0.7575 0.933797074635 30 3.44070002443 2.99194572555 

As with the physiological B cell maturation events of SHM and CSR, estrogen was able to increase the potentially pathogenic mutation frequency in CD95/Fas -LRB- Fig. 5 C and Fig. S7 B -RRB-. 
0.319938878985 0.6969 0.9393 0.4749368 36 4.2483849533 3.8741101 

This highlights the importance of regulating AID protein amounts within a cell, and the potential pathogenic consequences of unregulated AID expression. 
0.636841950307 0.405618 0.5151 0.419496482412 23 3.15214460485 1.61728116445 

In the past, we demonstrated that AID mRNA expression is not limited to activated B cells, but can also be detected in oocytes -LRB- 22 -RRB-. 
0.346924246376 0.516165418654 0.5454 0.567354456384 29 3.39511021238 2.76380696881 

We therefore set out to determine if the increase in AID mRNA production by estrogen was also detectable in dissected tissues and various tumor cell lines. 
0.377426034689 0.62923311828 0.6969 0.655970745731 27 2.73308008645 3.22346485819 

Because isolated oocytes produce AID mRNA -LRB- 22 -RRB-, we suggest that the increase was predominantly caused by oocytes or other ovarian-derived tissue, rather than infiltrating lymphocytes. 
0.996647269439 0.4848 0.7878 0.647345079365 30 3.17164611431 3.01491359788 

Gross tissue dissection can provide a good indication of possible cell types that can induce AID mRNA upon estrogen treatment, but tissue complexity could also obscure potential targets.

We hypothesized that hormonal responsiveness may have been conserved among members of the APOBEC3 family. 
0.597387351949 0.535397637073 0.404350285714 0.0655735858586 16 2.56314404104 0.456067959596 

Here, we propose another means by which estrogen can be a genotoxin, by directly inducing DNA deaminases such as AID.

Estrogen exerted its activity through the estrogen -- ER complex, directly binding to the AID promoter, whereas our preliminary data suggests that progesterone acts through an estrogen-independent pathway -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-. 
0.862810673162 0.6363 0.9696 0.2727 35 2.93396176617 2.58264 

The consequences of estrogen activation on AID mRNA could also be detected as an increase in AID protein and enhanced downstream physiological effects, such as SHM and CSR.

This could indicate that although AID production is necessary for SHM, other factors -LRB- e.g., lesion processing, AID targeting, etc -RRB- can play a significant role in overall SHM efficiency -LRB- 53 -RRB-. 
0.662449562597 0.747176 0.9999 0.749435457506 38 3.93750889965 5.28374193268 

Overexpression of AID in autoimmune-prone mice induced a more severe systemic lupus erythematosus -- like phenotype -LRB- 10 -RRB-, whereas breeding AID-deficient mice with autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr mice significantly reduced the onset and extent of disease -LRB- 11 -RRB-, indicating that alterations in AID can change the severity of B cell autoimmunity.

In addition to the direct binding of the estrogen -- ER complex to the AID promoter, estrogen may also hyperstimulate AID production through the NF-κB pathway, as we were able to demonstrate that cotreatment of TNF-α and estrogen enhanced NF-κB binding to the AID promoter -LRB- Fig. 3 D -RRB-. 
0.57118166069 0.974662002153 1.3635 0.875765705602 53 5.37777765036 5.5306722292 

There are several hypotheses on how unregulated AID can affect autoimmunity in addition to overstimulation of SHM and CSR, e.g., debilitating mutations in the signaling pathways, of tumor suppressors, or of proapoptotic genes, or alterations that activate oncogenes or antiapoptotic genes -LRB- for review see reference -LSB- 55 -RSB- -RRB-.

Therefore, our data on estrogen-induced mutations in CD95/Fas -LRB- Fig. 5 and Fig. S7 -RRB-, derived from increased AID production, may provide a novel molecular mechanism that is important for both pathologies. 
0.673888292268 0.5454 0.9999 0.753718740814 37 3.61979787357 5.25811105368 

Furthermore, because the estrogen derivative Tam -LRB- 61 -RRB- can inhibit estrogen 's oncogenesis in breast cancer, it is unlikely that estrogen -LRB- or its derivatives -RRB- form DNA adducts under those conditions.

Thus, our findings that low concentrations of Tam induced AID mRNA -LRB- Fig. S1 -RRB- also suggest that Tam acts as an agonist and indicates that the proposed usage of synthetic estrogen derivatives as a means to inhibit AID has to be carefully evaluated.

Future work on identifying a potential role of AID in mouse models of hormonally induced cancers may provide further evidence on how AID can act as an environmentally stimulated oncogene.

As our data indicate, AID 's response to estrogen seems to have been evolutionarily conserved among the APOBEC3 family members, different tissues, and cell lines -LRB- Fig. 6 and Fig. S8 -RRB- ; mouse Apobec3 and human APOBEC3B, -3 F, and -3 G -LRB- and - H to a lesser extent -RRB- mRNA were induced by estrogen treatment.

In the past, we have hypothesized that the predominant function of AID and its evolved DNA deaminase family members was to inactivate foreign DNA in the cell -LRB- 8, 34, 64, 65 -RRB-.

Mutations in genes within the EGFR-Ras and PI3K signaling pathways are common in malignant gliomas, although how these genes specifically control glial pathogenesis is unclear.

Thus, misregulation of these genetic pathways may confer unrestricted proliferative capacities to a range of glial cell types, but how this occurs remains unclear.

Finally, glial overgrowth in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX larvae was strongly suppressed by co-overexpression of dPTEN or more moderately by dominant negative dRas85D -LRB- dRas85DN17 -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1D and 1E -RRB-, indicating that Ras activity and excess phospho-inositols are essential for neoplasia.

dRas85DV12 may be more potent than dEGFRλ because dRas85DV12 can activate endogenous PI3K signaling -LSB- 16 -RSB-.

Unlike dEGFRλ, dEGFRWT and dEGFRElp have functional ligand-binding domains -LRB- Figure S1 -RRB-, and may cause additional defects by sequestering ligand otherwise required for normal development -LSB- 17 -RSB-.

Like neoplastic epithelial cells, dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia ectopically expressed an active form of the matrix metalloprotease dMMP1 -LRB- Figure S3 -RRB-, which can confer an invasive potential -LSB- 19 -RSB-, -LSB- 20 -RSB-, implying that abnormal dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia may be invasive within the brain.

Tumors also contained trachea embedded throughout their mass -LRB- Figure 3D and 3E and Video S1 -RRB-, suggesting that tumors stimulated growth of new trachea or enveloped existing trachea, perhaps in a process akin to tumor angiogenesis.

Cells from these double mutant clones appeared to invade the brain, typically following fiber tracts, and sometimes induced the formation of trachea -LRB- Figure 4E -RRB-.

We more commonly observed smaller dEGFR-dRas85D ; dPTEN - / - clones composed of relatively differentiated, enlarged glia with diffusely invasive projections -LRB- Figure 4G -RRB- ; these clones likely derive from glia that differentiated prior to achieving sufficient EGFR-Ras transgene expression, and are consistent with findings that not all glial subtypes become neoplastic.

EGFR-Ras signaling can promote proliferation through Erk kinase-mediated induction of nuclear targets.

This suggests that TORC2 loss might antagonize glial neoplasia through dFoxO upregulation.

Myc protein levels can also be posttranslationally upregulated by EGFR-Ras-Raf signaling -LSB- 16 -RSB-, -LSB- 51 -RSB-.

Thus, we suspected that dMyc might mediate signal integration between EGFR-Ras and PI3K.

dMyc-overexpressing glia showed polyploidy -LRB- Figure 8C, data not shown -RRB-, indicating that these cells undergo DNA replication without mitosis, but require additional signals for cell cycle progression.

In contrast, co-overexpression of dMyc with dEGFRλ produced a phenotype on par with that of repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX -LRB- Figure 8D -RRB-, indicating that dMyc overexpression can substitute for PI3K activation and promote neoplasia when combined with EGFR signaling.

Given that the dMyc targets dCyclinD-dCdk4 are required for dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX neoplasia, we tested whether dCyclinD-dCdk4 overexpression could cooperate with dEGFRλ. 
0.708556280664 0.5151 0.606 0.2121 24 4.41511045537 2.00872 

Thus, glia likely require additional dp110 or dMyc effectors to undergo full neoplastic proliferation.

Our data imply that PI3K, dMyc, and dCyclinD-dCdk4 exist in a linear system, in which Rbf1 inactivation by dCyclinD-dCdk4 is one direct output of dp110CAAX or dMyc.

However, in high-grade glioma, Rb loss co-occurs with EGFR and PTEN mutations -LSB- 2 -RSB-, implying that these mutations cooperate to promote gliomagenesis.

This synergistic interaction likely derives from derepression of dE2F1 upon Rbf1 loss, and concomitant increased expression of dE2F1 target genes, including Stg and dCyclinE -LSB- 53 -RSB-.

Phospho-MPM2 foci were present in glia of both genotypes, although repo > Rbf1dsRNA ; dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX brains appeared to have a higher density of glia with phospho-MPM2 foci -LRB- Figure S12 -RRB-, suggesting that expanded expression of dCyclinE results in broader activation of dCdk2.

When activated individually, these pathways fail to elicit glial neoplasia, implying a requirement for coordinated stimulation of multiple effectors and inactivation of negative regulators.

Orthologs for many of the genes within these pathways, such as dRictor, are implicated in human glioma, although specific roles for some, such as ETS transcription factors, have not been defined despite their expression in glioma -LSB- 2 -RSB-, -LSB- 57 -RSB-, -LSB- 58 -RSB-.

c-myc is commonly amplified in gliomas -LSB- 62 -RSB-, implying that Myc is rate limiting, and c-myc amplification may be selected for this reason.

Our data argue that Cdk4 activity is a key tumor-specific rate-limiting output of EGFR and PI3K signaling in glioma as well.

Rather, our results suggest that neoplastic cells arise from committed glial progenitors : dEGFR-dRas85D ; dPTEN - / - clones derived from progenitor cells produce large tumors, and anaplastic cells in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX brains are concentrated in regions enriched for glial progenitors.

Further studies of Drosophila glial progenitors and glioma-like cells may illuminate the cellular origins of human gliomas, which are thought to arise from progenitor-like glial cells.

Moreover, our results argue that cell-type specific factors govern glial neoplasia.

One such factor may be Dap, the single p21/p27 ortholog, which is normally expressed in only 5 % of all glia -LRB- Figure S4 -RRB-.

Perhaps glial progenitors do not express Dap, whereas neuronal progenitors do -LSB- 26 -RSB-, and this underlies susceptibility to transformation by EGFR-Ras and PI3K.

Dap is highly regulated in a cell-type specific manner -LSB- 26 -RSB-, and studies of Dap regulation in glia may further illuminate the genetic origins of glioma, especially given that lack of p21 expression may underlie the tumorigenic response of mammalian glial progenitors to constitutively active EGFR -LSB- 65 -RSB-.

Such a system may be especially useful for distinguishing those genetic mutations and pathways that drive tumorigenesis from the large number of genes that show mutations and altered expression in glioblastomas uncovered by recent genomic analyses of patient samples -LSB- 66 -RSB-, -LSB- 67 -RSB-.

Our studies have already identified key rate-limiting genes, such as dCyclinE, Stg, and dMyc, and genes only required for abnormal neoplastic glial proliferation, such as dSin1, dRictor, and dCdk4, which may represent important therapeutic targets in human gliomas.

We used antibody microinjection and genetic manipulations to dissect the various roles of the homotetrameric kinesin-5, KLP61F, in astral, centrosome-controlled Drosophila embryo spindles and to test the hypothesis that it slides apart interpolar -LRB- ip -RRB- microtubules -LRB- MT -RRB-, thereby controlling poleward flux and spindle length.

The resulting mitotic defects, supported by gene dosage experiments and time-lapse microscopy of living klp61f mutants, reveal that, after NEB, KLP61F drives persistent MT bundling and the outward sliding of antiparallel MTs, thereby contributing to several processes that all appear insensitive to cortical disruption.

Among these mitotic proteins, the kinesin-5 motor is thought to play a key role -LRB- Cottingham et al., 1999 ; Valentine et al., 2006a ; Civelekoglu-Scholey and Scholey, 2007 -RRB-.

In yeast cells the homotetrameric structure of kinesin-5 appears to be essential for mitosis -LRB- Hildebrandt et al., 2006 -RRB-, and in Drosophila embryos KLP61F displays dynamic properties consistent with an association with spindle MTs -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB- and forms presumptive MT -- MT cross-bridges -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a -RRB-.

These results suggest that ensembles of multiple kinesin-5 motors could serve as dynamic cross-links that organize spindle MTs into bundles and drive a sliding filament mechanism that pushes apart antiparallel spindle MTs -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-, although alternative mechanisms of action for kinesin-5 motors have also been proposed -LRB- Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Tsai et al., 2006 ; Johansen and Johansen, 2007 ; Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.

It is unclear if these findings are relevant to all spindles and if they all reflect the antiparallel MT sliding activity of kinesin-5, or if kinesin-5 functions differently in different systems as implied by the proposal that kinesin-5 functions as a MT depolymerase rather than a sliding motor to control chromosome congression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae -LRB- Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.

Biochemical evidence supports the idea that the prometaphase spindle is maintained by a KLP61F-Ncd force balance -LRB- Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, but it is unclear if the monoastral spindles form by the drawing together of focused poles due to Ncd-induced inward MT sliding or by the disorganization of spindle MTs combined with the fusion of microtubule organizing centers -LRB- Goshima and Vale, 2003 -RRB-.

We previously proposed that the KLP61F-driven outward sliding of ipMTs drives pre-anaphase B poleward flux and anaphase B spindle elongation -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-.

However, reductionist modeling -LRB- Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB- and system level modeling -LRB- Wollman et al., 2008 -RRB- surprisingly predicted that the rate of anaphase B pole -- pole separation is insensitive to the KLP61F concentration and is controlled instead by the unloaded KLP61F MT sliding velocity together with a pole-associated MT depolymerase.

Furthermore, it is unclear if some of these activities also require the activity of the overlying cortex, e.g., via cortical motors pulling astral MTs outward.

KLP61F antibody was generated against amino acids 900-1066, which includes the BimC box containing a mutation in which the putative phosphorylation site, Threonine 933, was mutated to aspartic acid.

Toward the bottom of the embryo, KLP61F-GFP is still present on the spindles and consequently these spindles assemble, though they may exhibit defects.

After KLP61F inhibition spindles collapse with a correlated increase in tubulin intensity, suggesting that MTs are sliding inward and not depolymerizing.

The increase is much higher than that observed in wild-type spindles, indicating that it is not due to a normal increase in tubulin.

Studies using transient transfection with Eg5 mutants in cultured Xenopus cells -LRB- Sawin and Mitchison, 1995 -RRB-, with KLP61F mutants in live Drosophila embryos -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB- and using antibodies raised against phospho - and unphospho-epitopes in Drosophila embryos -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a -RRB- suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved Thr-933 residue in the bimC box of kinesin-5 is critical for its localization to the spindle.

The latter result was intriguing because we had previously proposed that KLP61F-driven ipMT sliding drives anaphase B, yet in studying the gradient of intermediate phenotypes -LRB- Figures 1B and 2C -RRB-, we did not observe spindles that circumvented the prometaphase collapse but then failed to elongate normally during subsequent anaphase B. 
0.732175471287 1.06052435028 1.4847 1.17550757312 53 7.91744785819 8.31780585145 

This is, in fact, consistent with mathematical modeling predicting that the rate of anaphase spindle elongation is independent of the number of motors, at least above a low threshold number -LRB- Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ; Wollman et al., 2008 -RRB-. 
0.702699339199 0.790996899889 0.9999 0.993799245744 47 4.90558572867 7.08390939457 

We hypothesized that spindles containing sufficient KLP61F motor to circumvent collapse and progress through prometaphase might also contain enough motor to elongate the spindle at normal rates during anaphase B.

We further reasoned that, because Ncd generates an inward force capable of antagonizing KLP61F -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, in the absence of Ncd function, we might improve our chances of encountering spindles with sufficient KLP61F to proceed through prometaphase but below the threshold level of KLP61F needed to drive normal rates of anaphase B. 
1.2458475554 1.212 1.7271 0.934989766054 66 8.33200599882 8.75742145412 

In such spindles, a decreased rate of anaphase B spindle elongation should be observed. 
0.276037135347 0.65684 0.3939 0.293071845293 16 2.65084495921 1.22375807181 

In uninjected mutants, pole -- pole separation occurred prematurely from prometaphase onward, supporting our hypothesis that Ncd serves as a `` brake '' that exerts an inward force on spindle poles, antagonistic to KLP61F -LRB- Figure 2D, dark blue -RRB-. 
0.32289616041 1.0605 1.2423 1.22319823159 45 4.56426108209 8.2478267542 

Pole -- pole separation in Ncd null embryos occurs shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown -LRB- NEB -RRB-, earlier than in wild-type embryos, suggesting that normally Ncd 's braking activity is turned on throughout prometaphase.

This result suggests that, when KLP61F and Ncd function are both missing, another inward force-generator must drive pole -- pole collapse. 
0.927512233748 0.4242 0.6666 0.454513626943 24 3.91727737412 4.51623445596 

This failure to elongate was not observed in anti-KLP61F -- injected wild-type embryos, and it supports the hypothesis that KLP61F is necessary for anaphase B. 
0.405890525213 0.469925810811 0.5757 0.702177111111 26 4.52156500969 4.28223316667 

We wanted to better understand if the spindle length defects we observe after loss of kinesin-5 function reflect defects in spindle pole separation -LRB- Saunders et al., 1997 ; Sharp et al., 2000a -RRB- or in spindle pole focusing -LRB- Gaglio et al., 1996 ; Goshima and Vale, 2003 -RRB-.

This indicates that ipMT bundles become thicker during the collapse, consistent with spindle shortening being due to an inward sliding of adjacent, antiparallel ipMTs, although serial section electron microscopy -LRB- EM -RRB- done at time intervals during the collapse, which is probably not feasible, would be required to establish this. 
1.5357498098 0.909210927238 1.4241 0.894124095533 56 7.10749496278 7.62845052632 

These observations are consistent with the idea that KLP61F is required for the separation of spindle poles in the rapid, centrosome-dominant mitoses of the syncytial embryo, but as development proceeds, mitosis slows down -LRB- see below -RRB- and centrosomes become less dominant, so that KLP61F plays increasingly important roles in anastral spindle pole focusing. 
0.851851490549 1.15318100215 1.4847 1.91459974719 59 9.34012650675 9.08835333528 

Further evidence in support of the idea that KLP61F exerts outward forces on spindle poles was obtained by examining embryos carrying varying `` doses '' of the KLP61F gene -LRB- Figure 3C -RRB-. 
0.685160158638 0.824943004306 1.78779 0.250708872364 34 5.07292606007 2.97057812864 

For example, during prometaphase wild types harboring two copies of the KLP61F gene separated their spindle poles further than klp61f mutant heterozygotes containing a single copy, suggesting that the predicted increase in the concentration of the motor increases the outward force that pushes apart the poles -LRB- Figure 3C, left -RRB-.

On the basis of comparisons of the rates of poleward flux within ipMT bundles and the rates of MT sliding induced by purified KLP61F, as well as the observation that poleward flux stops at the onset of anaphase B, we previously proposed that KLP61F drives poleward flux in Drosophila embryos, but this had not been tested in vivo -LRB- Cole et al., 1994 ; Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-. 
0.889363285859 1.44404393764 2.20426 2.26894238929 87 10.9478553235 16.3670376001 

This indicates that KLP61F-driven MT sliding is necessary to achieve the wild-type metaphase spindle length and that it also contributes to poleward flux in both ipMTs and kMTs. 
0.470278579407 0.561526428571 0.7272 0.667772223361 29 5.5258230226 5.40799669057 

A possible source of negative flux numbers, especially close to zero, is noise in the measurements. 
0.626220630709 0.2424 0.5151 0.649241492496 19 2.40009228793 3.04932375408 

A more interesting possibility is that they represent speckles on ipMTs associated with one pole that slide inward as the spindle transiently shortens, bringing them closer to the pole in the opposite half spindle. 
0.748371703845 0.7154328 0.9393 0.485261613008 36 5.96221490749 4.83256711897 

Such a speckle would flux toward the first pole but away from the second, now closer, pole, and this would be measured as negative flux.

-LRB- B -RRB- In embryos injected with anti-KLP61F antibody, kymographs obtained from spindles that did not collapse but maintained a steady length show that tubulin speckles do not flux toward the pole, indicating that the function of KLP61F is required for this movement -LRB- see Supplemental Video 2 for speckled movie -RRB-.

Significantly, the lower rate of 0.06 µm / s parallels the observed lack of poleward flux -LRB- previous section -RRB- and supports the idea that anaphase A is driven by a combined `` flux-pacman '' mechanism in Drosophila embryos -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Maddox et al., 2002 ; Rogers et al., 2004 -RRB-.

Cortical pulling forces could complement the outward sliding of ipMTs to control pole -- pole spacing. 
0.295354053321 0.4242 0.4545 0.303 17 2.59627905698 2.8696 

If cortical dynein or cortical MT depolymerases play a significant role in pulling spindle poles apart by sliding astral MTs outward relative to the actin cortex, this activity should be reduced or eliminated due to the depletion of actin caps and furrows in these mutants. 
0.97570537896 1.171376 1.2726 1.18052540219 47 8.02795952586 5.65046154622 

This could reflect the sliding apart of MTs either by outward ipMT sliding by KLP61F or, during anaphase B, by outward pulling by cortical forces.

In wild-type spindles, speckles move at a rate of 0.05 ± 0.02 µm / s, in spg mutants they move at 0.05 ± 0.02 µm / s, and in sced mutants at 0.06 ± 0.02 µm / s -LRB- Supplemental Figure S1 -RRB-, indicating that outward pulling by cortical forces is not significant throughout metaphase and anaphase. 
1.19932634368 1.46982581081 1.7271 2.7358606997 62 10.6999284956 12.5988258859 

However, cortical pulling forces apparently do not play a significant role after metaphase onset, whereupon KLP61F becomes the major force generator for the outward sliding of ipMTs that underlies poleward flux and anaphase spindle elongation.

The work suggests that MT -- MT crosslinking and sliding by KLP61F contributes to 1 -RRB- the maintenance of prometaphase spindles as chromosomes are captured ; 2 -RRB- poleward flux in ipMTs and kMTs ; 3 -RRB- the bundling and organization of MTs throughout the spindle ; 4 -RRB- the control of pre-anaphase B spindle length ; 5 -RRB- tight congression, kinetochore -- kinetochore spacing and the rate of anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motility ; and 6 -RRB- the elongation of the anaphase B spindle in a manner that is relatively insensitive to the KLP61F concentration -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB-.

We propose that kinesin-5 motors function as ensembles of dynamic, transient, MT crosslinkers throughout the spindle -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a ; Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB-, organizing parallel MTs into bundles -LRB- inset i -RRB- and sliding apart antiparallel MTs -LRB- inset ii -RRB-, in accordance with the biochemical properties of KLP61F -LRB- e.g., Cole et al., 1994 ; Kashina et al., 1996a ; Tao et al., 2006 ; Van den Wildenberg et al., 2008 -RRB-.

The kMTs may be slid poleward -LRB- dashed blue arrows -RRB- via crosslinks to the actively sliding antiparallel ipMTs.

The results support previous studies suggesting that KLP61F is dispensable for the assembly of astral syncytial embryo spindles but is essential for prometaphase spindle maintenance where it is antagonized by Ncd -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999b ; Sharp et al., 2000a ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, and it further implicates the action of an additional, unknown, inward motor, possibly the MT depolymerase, KLP10A.

In the spindles that fail to elongate, we propose that there is enough KLP61F to prevent spindle collapse but not enough to drive anaphase B -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB-.

We propose that the sliding apart of ipMTs by KLP61F would also push kMTs poleward, if the kMTs are mechanically coupled to the sliding ipMTs by KLP61F -LRB- or other -RRB- MT -- MT cross-linkers -LRB- Figure 6 ; Sharp et al., 1999a ; Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB-.

Depolymerization of ipMTs and kMTs at the poles would then create KLP61F-dependent poleward flux.

The slowing down of anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motility resulting from KLP61F inhibition could be explained by the loss of flux because it has been shown that in Drosophila embryos, anaphase A is driven by a combined flux-pacman mechanism -LRB- Rogers et al., 2004 -RRB-.

This may also be due to the loss of flux ; i.e., normally as MTs slide outward, they generate a pulling force on the kinetochores.

We hypothesize that the syncytial embryo spindles that we study are adapted for rapid mitoses -LRB- Civelekoglu-Scholey et al., 2006 -RRB- and consequently their assembly and function is dominated by the centrosome-directed pathway so that, unlike in larvae, S2 cells and many other cells, the chromosome-directed spindle assembly pathway plays a lesser role -LRB- Heald et al., 1997 ; Megraw et al., 2001 -RRB-.

Our results showing that KLP61F appears to contribute to the length of pre-anaphase B spindles in living embryos differ from the results obtained in fixed S2 cells where, above the critical concentration required for bipolar spindle assembly, increasing concentrations of KLP61F did not influence metaphase spindle length -LRB- Goshima et al., 2005b -RRB-.

Although we can not rule out an influence of technical differences between the two studies, we suspect that they reflect genuine system-specific differences, akin to the different consequences of loss of Ncd function in embryos versus cultured cells of Drosophila -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Goshima et al., 2005a ; Morales-Mulia and Scholey, 2005 -RRB-.

As in Drosophila embryos, the kinesin-5 motors appear to contribute to metaphase spindle length -LRB- Saunders et al., 1997 -RRB- and to anaphase spindle elongation -LRB- Saunders et al., 1995 ; Straight et al., 1998 -RRB-.

In some respects, therefore, the manner in which kinesin-5 is deployed in Drosophila embryos resembles yeast more closely than S2 cells, again possibly reflecting the relative dominance of centrosomes and spindle pole bodies. 
2.22928378885 1.60599 0.9696 2.53986385551 37 5.82974042555 7.81935869201 

In other respects the two systems may differ significantly ; for instance, although kinesin-5 contributes to congression in Drosophila embryos and yeast, the proposed underlying mechanisms are very different -LRB- Figure 6 and Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-. 
1.39638546234 0.642837619048 1.1211 1.24769594595 42 3.90333775505 9.34377621622 

In vertebrate cultured cells, in contrast, the inhibition of Eg5 function led to only a 25 % decrease in the rate of poleward flux while spindle length remained normal, suggesting only minor contributions from kinesin-5 -LRB- Cameron et al., 2006 -RRB-. 
1.19640778367 0.7272 1.1211 0.710616074798 46 6.23366770711 7.17187358238 

The latter authors also reported a small decrease in kinetochore -- kinetochore spacing after Eg5 inhibition, supporting the notion that kinesin-5 may contribute to the exertion of poleward tension on kinetochores in some systems, including the Drosophila embryo -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB-. 
1.50542996728 1.29371078947 1.1211 1.45565669583 45 6.04397947347 5.69895969564 

Thus, mitotic motors can be deployed to carry out very different functions in different types of spindles, presenting a challenge for the formulation of general, integrated models of kinesin-5 function. 
0.831748459327 1.24509054253 1.305544 0.664767975823 34 5.77754961244 3.71895562009 

By cross-linking parallel MTs, KLP61F would `` zip '' together adjacent MTs to bundle and organize spindle MTs but would generate no force on them. 
0.359979960625 0.6666 0.7575 0.583718621013 27 3.8536821124 3.42855949343 

By cross-linking and moving toward the plus ends of antiparallel ipMTs, however, it would persistently slide them apart to drive poleward flux when ipMT sliding is balanced by ipMT depolymerization at spindle poles, or to exert outward forces on spindles poles when ipMT depolymerization is turned off -LRB- McIntosh et al., 1969 ; Sharp et al., 1999a ; Van den Wildenberg et al., 2008 -RRB-. 
1.16988958585 1.56332336932 1.9134177551 1.78933699872 72 10.3901525515 14.4287273075 

In the current study, this KLP61F-driven, outward ipMT sliding was directly visualized by monitoring fluorescent tubulin speckle behavior -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-, and it appeared to be antagonized by the inward sliding of ipMTs during prometaphase. 
0.849876061054 0.888105635739 1.1817 0.82769575916 49 7.09697890159 6.45356214084 

This is consistent with the hypothesis that KLP61F-driven outward sliding of ipMTs, augmented at specific stages by other ipMT-bound proteins such as KLP3A -LRB- Kwon et al., 2004 -RRB-, plays a central role. 
0.711800937565 0.578259642857 0.8787 1.15530386112 37 4.61688709118 6.10712557278 

We do not want to extrapolate our sliding filament model for kinesin-5 function in Drosophila syncytial embryos -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- to other systems where the molecular mechanism of action of kinesin-5 may be different -LRB- e.g., Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-. 
0.964895278007 0.763953247206 1.3029 0.953461579365 51 5.61044003482 8.88761074603 

Elsewhere, many kinesin-5 motors have not been purified and studied biochemically, so it is possible that some kinesin-5 motors may act differently, e.g., serving as MT depolymerases -LRB- Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB- or sliding MTs relative to a spindle matrix -LRB- Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 -RRB-. 
2.36795656312 1.23824785694 1.99031411765 2.60333882937 54 7.91200764877 9.58001932331 

Further biochemical studies on the mechanism of action of purified kinesin-5 from multiple systems would obviously be fruitful.

Of course, this imperfection would remain undetected if the same mechanism had been described only qualitatively, but it shows that this model requires further refinement to explain the KLP61F concentration versus spindle length data. 
0.629593980356 0.889317349206 1.130045 0.5072693786 37 6.46690158466 2.98814308382 

This work supports the idea that the KLP61F/Ncd force balance engages immediately after NEB as dynamic ipMT bundles start to form, whereas the subsequent elongation phase requires additional outward acting force-generators, for example, KLP3A on chromosome arms and cortical dynein -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Kwon et al., 2004 -RRB-. 
0.526751202781 0.996619 1.3635 1.25533206942 57 6.73499383033 8.48936216387 

Our own force-balance models for spindle assembly and function are based on the premise that antagonistic motors mediate the relative sliding -LRB- e.g., kinesin-5 and -14 -RRB- or depolymerization -LRB- e.g., kinesin-13 -RRB- of ipMTs, but other scenarios are also possible. 
0.86429245761 0.854266451613 1.1211 1.00744339394 45 5.14624941416 6.24616539394 

For example, a new `` slide-and-cluster '' model for anastral spindle assembly proposes that kinesin-5 transports MTs that assemble around chromosomes to the spindle poles where they are focused by minus-end -- directed motors -LRB- Burbank et al., 2007 -RRB-. 
0.381269374673 0.7575454375 1.0605 0.80123144365 43 5.40144429606 7.78814442033 

However, in Drosophila syncytial embryo spindles, where MT assembly is nucleated predominantly at centrosomes, MTs turn over very quickly -LRB- half-time, 5 s -RRB-, and it seems unlikely that kinesin-5 would have sufficient time to transport MTs to the spindle poles for focusing there -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2007 -RRB-. 
1.13855210741 1.58578584795 1.515 2.708379 57 7.98583116551 13.38043 

This suggestion again implies that kinesin-5 is deployed in different ways in different systems. 
0.791244091783 0.2121 0.3939 0.741292813527 15 3.20023468271 1.92222675393 

Failure to establish an appropriate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of severe malaria. 
0.453534239972 1.1911862069 0.5454 0.612880117242 22 2.78339927906 2.6924985992 

To determine whether this balance is maintained by classical regulatory T cells -LRB- CD4 + FOXP3 + CD127 - / low ; Tregs -RRB- we compared cellular responses between Gambian children -LRB- n = 124 -RRB- with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria or uncomplicated malaria infections. 
0.929892353325 1.69952166667 1.773055 1.11990001418 46 5.51876503575 7.84309183252 

Thus, while Tregs may not regulate acute malarial inflammation, they may limit memory responses to levels that subsequently facilitate parasite clearance without causing immunopathology. 
0.619047524592 0.516381145833 0.6969 0.456370982143 27 2.99943939191 3.04254 

While Tregs have been implicated in regulation of the immune response to chronic infections, their potential in determining disease outcome in acute infections is unclear. 
1.16720370832 0.608768351359 0.7272 0.676055424119 27 4.22770788698 3.05244876897 

Further, we identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10-producing Th-1 effector cells and found that IL-10-producing Th-1 cells were associated with development of uncomplicated as opposed to severe malaria, leading us to suggest that such `` self-regulating '' Th-1 cells may contribute to clearing malaria infections without inducing immune-mediated pathology.

In addition, we found evidence that malaria-induced Tregs may limit the magnitude of malaria-specific memory responses detectable 28 days later, which may reduce the risk of immune-mediated pathology upon reinfection and may explain how immunity to severe disease can be gained after as little as one or two infections. 
1.6024153278 0.758380275862 1.3029 1.23237937474 52 7.23336573185 7.96938542978 

The clinical spectrum of P. falciparum infection ranges from asymptomatic parasite carriage to a febrile disease that may develop into a severe, life-threatening illness. 
0.669396438847 0.454568456376 0.6969 0.205468272303 26 2.82575208032 1.48005855424 

The factors that determine disease severity are not completely understood but are likely to include both parasite and host components -LSB- 1 -RSB- -- -LSB- 3 -RSB-. 
0.736701061443 0.779835810811 0.7575 0.346541333333 28 3.68424770126 3.507316 

Ultimately, the interplay between the parasite and the immune response likely determines the outcome of the infection -LSB- 4 -RSB-. 
0.443896226587 0.308062002153 0.4848 0.177200351544 22 1.31170193602 2.01933951743 

Although sterile immunity - completely preventing re-infection - is hardly ever seen and protection against clinical symptoms of uncomplicated disease is only acquired after repeated infections -LSB- 5 -RSB-, immunity to severe disease and death may be acquired after as few as one or two infections -LSB- 6 -RSB- suggesting that different immune mechanisms underlie these different levels of immunity. 
3.19597307236 1.24182231156 1.7574 4.92592178996 62 9.09052058331 14.8249494917 

While there is a growing consensus that killing of malaria parasites or malaria-infected red blood cells requires the synergistic action of antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses -LSB- 5 -RSB-, -LSB- 7 -RSB-, the mechanisms conferring protection against severe disease are less clear. 
0.702904710997 0.833607083869 1.30363142857 2.59469569893 45 4.87844595966 7.45476229831 

Induced and/or activated in response to malaria infection -LSB- 27 -RSB-, Tregs may be beneficial to the host in the later part of the infection - when parasitaemia is being cleared - by down-regulating the inflammatory response and thereby preventing immune-mediated pathology. 
0.912806205441 0.855251593711 1.04153911765 0.635549679549 44 5.81303733752 6.34115742307 

On the other hand, if Tregs mediate their suppressive effects too early, this could hamper the responses required for initial control of parasitaemia, permitting unbridled parasite growth which may also lead to severe disease. 
0.797627218555 0.548272645161 0.9696 0.539204740187 38 4.94598249172 4.82439793429 

Malaria-specific induction of Tregs has been observed in a variety of experimental malaria infections in mice -LSB- 28 -RSB- -- -LSB- 31 -RSB-, but their role in preventing severe malarial pathology is unclear. 
1.65218304909 1.50867514473 1.65847574468 0.855519474083 35 6.22533590312 5.14364455507 

Depleting CD25 + cells of BALB/c mice infected with either P. berghei NK65 -LSB- 34 -RSB- or P berghei ANKA -LSB- 35 -RSB- reduced neither parasitaemia nor mortality, but increased the severity of symptoms in the diseased mice, suggesting at least some benefit from Tregs in this model. 
1.84750504019 1.07023114286 1.4544 1.08820457188 51 6.67309260158 8.92373184692 

Malaria naive individuals undergoing experimental P. falciparum sporozoite infection showed an increase in FOXP3 mRNA expression and expansion of Tregs 10 days after infection ; Treg induction correlated with high circulating levels of TGF-ß, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and rapid parasite growth -LSB- 27 -RSB- suggesting - but not proving - that Treg activation early in infection may inhibit the development of effective cellular immunity. 
1.92310844303 1.3635 1.8786 2.0578217563 68 9.51873987875 13.0536104274 

However, although Tregs have been implicated in IL-10-mediated down-regulation of Th1-like responses in the placenta of malaria-infected women -LSB- 37 -RSB- and reduced Treg frequencies and function have been linked to enhanced anti-parasite immunity in certain ethnic groups in West Africa -LSB- 38 -RSB- the potential for Tregs to influence the clinical outcome of malaria infections is still unclear. 
2.28375149445 1.37323450596 1.6665 3.15066903885 61 11.1396366571 10.5224413588 

Interestingly, although we did not observe any significant differences in Treg numbers or function between severe and uncomplicated malaria cases, our data do indicate that malaria-induced Tregs may limit the magnitude of malaria-specific Th1 memory responses and thus moderate pro-inflammatory responses to subsequent infections, providing a possible explanation for the very rapid acquisition of immunity to severe malaria. 
1.64107157315 1.27485501695 1.6665 1.67316784398 62 8.26768145209 7.30749860055 

On admission, only 12 -LRB- 9.4 % -RRB- patients had a white blood cell count -LRB- WBC -RRB- above the age-specific norm and there was no significant difference in median WBC count between uncomplicated and severe cases, suggesting that few if any children had a concomitant systemic bacterial infection. 
1.72702339553 0.946985825478 1.2912283871 1.8132121157 52 6.3299697669 6.70809831332 

Taken together, these data indicate that in both uncomplicated and severe cases of malaria Tregs are predominantly of a memory phenotype and are activated during acute malaria infection. 
0.539763023405 0.515245340909 0.7575 1.03583555267 30 3.86287709044 2.70854115151 

Finally, since high concentrations of TNF-α have been reported to impair Treg activity -LRB- by upregulating and then signaling via TNFR2, leading to decreased FOXP3 mRNA and protein expression -LSB- 46 -RSB- -RRB-, and the functional impairment of Tregs observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients can be reversed by anti-TNF-α antibodies -LSB- 47 -RSB-, we considered the hypothesis that the high levels of TNF-α seen in severe malaria patients -LSB- 13 -RSB-, -LSB- 15 -RSB-, might upregulate TNFR2 and impair Treg function. 
2.48570907028 2.38764622103 2.92718 1.72907316261 88 13.8852159253 13.6097869377 

Since the balance of T-effector to Treg responses is likely to be as important, or more important, than the absolute levels of either -LSB- 26 -RSB-, we compared the ratio of the levels of mRNA for the Th1 transcription factor T-BET with those for FOXP3, currently considered the best marker for Tregs, and the ratio of T-effector cells -LRB- defined as CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 -, T-effector -RRB- over Tregs among the various groups. 
2.45921371315 3.57825411954 2.0907 1.79926548485 84 11.9813584339 12.6535229706 

The ratio of FOXP3 to GATA-3 -LRB- Th2 lineage factor -RRB- mRNA was similar for both time points in all groups -LRB- data not shown -RRB- but the Th1/Th2 ratio -LRB- T-BET/GATA -3 mRNA -RRB- was significantly higher during acute disease in children with CM, SA or SRD compared to those suffering from severe prostration -LRB- p = 0.0075 -RRB-, indicating that the expansion of the T-effector population is biased towards Th1 responses. 
1.33946086449 1.42012200215 2.0907 2.39555310603 76 9.48820706589 13.1701126231 

These data confirm previous studies indicating a shift towards a more inflammatory response during acute and severe malaria but, significantly, our data extend the previous observations by revealing that this inflammation is not balanced by a commensurate increase in Treg function. 
0.668701259723 0.942958610811 1.2726 2.38387466695 44 6.32279939656 7.01436620372 

For both severe and uncomplicated cases, levels of IFN-γ mRNA were highly correlated with levels of IL-10 mRNA during the acute phase -LRB- severe : r = 0.833 p < 0.001, uncomplicated : r = 0.693 p < 0.001 -RRB-, suggesting that IFN-γ production is being balanced by IL-10 production.

Interestingly, IFN-γ mRNA levels on day 0 correlated with FOXP3 mRNA on day 0 for both severe -LRB- r : 0.39 p = 0.003 -RRB- and uncomplicated cases -LRB- r : 0.44 p = 0.0001 -RRB-, suggesting that IFN-γ may also be driving FOXP3 expression.

IL-10 is a crucial immunoregulatory cytokine in both human -LSB- 23 -RSB- and murine -LSB- 33 -RSB-, -LSB- 49 -RSB- malaria ; we have recently identified CD4 + T effector cells as a major source of IL-10 -LSB- 33 -RSB-, but the source of IL-10 in human malaria infection is unknown.

We therefore cultured freshly isolated PBMCs from 30 children with acute malaria -LRB- 17 severe, 13 uncomplicated -RRB- and 20 healthy control children, with or without PMA and Ionomycin -LRB- PI -RRB-, for 5 hours and analyzed them for the presence of intracellular IL-10 and IFN-γ by flow cytometry -LRB- Figure 6A -RRB-.

No cytokine production was observed in unstimulated cells -LRB- data not shown -RRB-, and PBMC from healthy children failed to produce any IL-10 in response to PI -LRB- data not shown -RRB-, indicating that stimulation with PI predominantly induces cytokine production from recently activated cells.

Taken together, these data indicate that during acute, uncomplicated or severe, malaria infections IL-10 producing cells are overwhelmingly T effector cells and that Th1 effector cells that also produce IL-10 are more prevalent in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria. 
0.508878985601 0.791881568627 1.3332 1.22330924295 48 5.7103467872 8.2325121896 

It has been reported that Tregs present at the time of infection -LSB- 54 -RSB- or vaccination -LSB- 55 -RSB- may restrict the development of subsequent Th1 memory responses.

To determine whether Tregs present during acute malaria infection might similarly affect the induction of immunological memory, we compared FOXP3 mRNA levels on day 0 with malaria specific IFN-γ memory responses -LRB- as assessed by PfSE-specific cultured ELISPOT -RRB- among PBMC collected from 34 of our convalescent malaria patients -LRB- 19 severe and 15 uncomplicated -RRB- on Day 28.

When plotted against FOXP3 mRNA levels measured on day 0, a linear by linear hyperbolic fit revealed that higher levels of FOXP3 mRNA on day 0 were highly significantly -LRB- p = 0.009 -RRB- associated with lower malaria-specific IFN-γ memory responses on Day 28, suggesting that Tregs induced during the acute infection may limit the magnitude of subsequent Th1 responses -LRB- Figure 7B -RRB-.

We hypothesized that the balance of inflammatory to regulatory immune responses would be biased towards a more inflammatory response in children with severe malaria than in children with uncomplicated malaria, that this balance would be restored during convalescence and -- crucially -- that this would be associated with differences in the proportion, absolute number or function of circulating classical -LRB- CD4 + CD127 - / lo FOXP3 + -RRB- regulatory T cells.

Given our previous observation of Treg expansion during the pre-patent phase of malaria infection -LSB- 27 -RSB-, we suggest that Tregs are induced/activated shortly after parasite emergence from the liver, that their numbers in peripheral blood then decline as a result of sequestration of CD4 + T cells during acute disease -LSB- 40 -RSB-, -LSB- 41 -RSB-, -LSB- 56 -RSB- and then, as has been described for other T cell subsets -LSB- 39 -RSB-, -LSB- 57 -RSB-, Tregs regain access to the circulation after malaria is cured. 
1.76003769319 2.90534290476 2.766245 3.11340368267 95 9.36709917025 14.2825110054 

Moreover, the Tregs circulating during acute malaria infections almost exclusively expressed an activated memory phenotype suggesting that they have expanded from a pre-existing pool of memory T-cells. 
1.05490797061 0.5757 0.7272 0.525498240822 29 3.24867285342 4.56953897386 

This interpretation would be in line with recent elegant work in humans demonstrating that Tregs are derived by rapid turnover of memory populations in vivo -LSB- 59 -RSB-, and with data from murine studies where, after CD25-depletion, malaria infection very rapidly drives differentiation of Tregs from circulating mature CD4 + T cells -LSB- 60 -RSB-. 
1.15073688952 1.48569333333 1.6362 1.53379136805 59 8.51030355109 9.39630749097 

Obviously, it would be of interest to study the relationship between Tregs and effector T cell kinetics and parasite biomass, which is not readily measurable. 
1.05005923798 0.709724611801 0.811915384615 1.55898047246 28 5.88483533803 5.07847183087 

Furthermore, the similar distortion in the T-BET/FOXP3 mRNA ratio during acute disease and the lack of any marked differences between the two groups in ratios of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the close correlation between IFN-γ and IL-10 in both groups which is in line with previous observations in experimental human malaria infections -LSB- 62 -RSB-, suggests that the systemic shift towards a pro-inflammatory immune response is similar in children with either severe or uncomplicated disease. 
1.98344407399 1.30952342324 1.9695 1.8176248705 82 10.2048654438 9.68423624352 

However, we did observe significantly higher Th1 effector responses -LRB- more T-effector cells, higher concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α -RRB- in severely ill children than in children with uncomplicated disease, suggesting that the classical FOXP3 + Treg response that develops during acute malaria infection may be insufficient to balance the florid effector T cell response that develops particularly in children with severe disease. 
1.81634984091 1.24185260396 1.8786 1.64925971914 67 9.57430132599 8.98277227294 

Intriguingly, the proportion of these cells within the total CD4 + T cell population was significantly higher in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria suggesting that in human P. falciparum infection, as in murine T.gondii infections -LSB- 50 -RSB-, IL-10 producing Th1 cells, activated by a strong inflammatory stimulus, may act as anti-parasitic effector cells with a `` built in '' control mechanism to prevent the onset of immune pathology. 
1.74312096384 1.28309166667 2.3028 1.28933732542 80 9.8973399222 12.0876337179 

Although -LRB- Tregs may not seem to determine the outcome of current P. falciparum infections -RRB- we did find evidence that they affect the magnitude of the malaria specific memory response induced by the current infection. 
0.962431531286 0.739237002153 0.9393 0.897795252997 37 4.4562352012 5.8166724374 

Thus, malaria specific Tregs acquired during a primary infection may limit the magnitude of Th1 effector responses to subsequent infections to a level that allows parasite clearance without causing immunopathology. 
0.522792782005 0.575768456376 0.8181 0.545708098804 32 3.69654444359 4.65755332399 

Future studies should be designed to test the hypothesis that Tregs may contribute to the very rapid development of resistance to severe malaria. 
0.667091535465 0.426430666666 0.4848 0.605559708618 24 3.76640725701 2.68814807651 

In summary, our data indicate that classical FOXP3 + Tregs are unable to control the florid inflammation that accompanies acute malaria infections and this component of the immunoregulatory arsenal is rapidly overwhelmed in children with either mild or severe malaria. 
0.455632041796 0.823162002153 1.0908 0.657277625787 42 5.20897145423 3.93681165696 

Importantly however we have identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10 producing Th1 effector cells which appear to be a major source of this key anti-inflammatory cytokine during acute malaria infection, and which are associated with development of uncomplicated as opposed to severe malaria. 
0.951292174363 0.748217135122 1.2423 0.704737680901 55 7.36016064245 7.05595934058 

We propose that IL-10-producing Th1 cells may be the essential regulators of acute infection-induced inflammation and that such `` self-regulating '' Th1 cells may be essential for the infection to be cleared without inducing immune-mediated pathology.

For example, it was proposed that AML1-ETO may function by sequestering transcription factors -LRB- such as E-box proteins -RRB-, SON, or other regulatory proteins into subnuclear compartments13 ,23 and that its DNA binding function may not be necessary .13

Mechanisms invoking off-DNA activities including sequestration of transcriptional complexes and disruption of wild-type TEL function have also been proposed .58 -- 60

Wild-type Runt domain -LRB- 45 µM -RRB- was titrated with 440 µM CBFß at 26 ° C, and 42 µM T161A or 38 µM Y113A/T161A were titrated with 396 µM CBFß at 22 ° C.

Interestingly, it appears that the threshold level above which AML1-ETO can not tolerate disruption of CBFß binding and maintain clonogenicity lies above 60-fold, as the T161A mutant retains activity for at least 3 weeks in this assay -LRB- Figure 2D -RRB-. 
0.517655208075 0.897086818533 1.1817 1.29987380952 44 5.27989583356 5.28454666667 

Both aforementioned mouse studies reported that mutation of leucine 148 to aspartic acid -LRB- L148D -RRB- within the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, which disrupts DNA binding16 and presumably causes a severe disruption of domain stability ,30,65 resulted in a loss of cooperation with either oncogene .82,83

These studies underscored the importance of the Runt domain for AML1-ETO 's cooperative activity, but did not address whether disruption of DNA binding, CBFß heterodimerization, or both were responsible for the observed effect.

We predicted that if mutations in AML1-ETO impaired its leukemogenic activity, the disease would more closely resemble the CMPD caused by TEL-PDGFßR alone. 
0.426359944747 0.3939 0.6363 0.303 25 3.58964477984 2.8696 

We were able to transplant AML1-ETO plus TEL-PDGFßR expressing cells into secondary recipients and reconstitute the disease, but only using large numbers -LRB- > 2 × 106 -RRB- of freshly isolated splenocytes, and not with frozen cells -LRB- not shown -RRB-, indicating that the percentage of leukemia initiating cells was low.

Their average spleen sizes were similar to those of mice transplanted with BM expressing AML1-ETO plus TEL-PDGFßR or TEL-PDGFßR alone, and were significantly greater than those of mice transplanted with BM expressing AML1-ETO alone -LRB- Figure 3D -RRB-, indicating that TEL-PDGFßR contributed significantly to the splenomegaly. 
1.08060520963 0.9696 1.212 1.0302 49 7.04178625696 9.75664 

We speculate that the Y113A/T161A mutant has residual activity and that more highly expressing cells partially overcome the effects of the mutations and thus are positively selected.

We suspect our inability to detect AML1-ETO was due to the relatively low percentage of AML1-ETO expressing spleen cells -LRB- Figure 3F -RRB-.

Interestingly, the FACS profiles of EGFP + hCD4 + BM cells from the AML1-ETO -LRB- Y113A/T161A -RRB- plus TEL-PDGFßR group were not identical to those of the AML1-ETO -LRB- R174Q -RRB- plus TEL-PDGFßR group and appeared to be intermediate between CMPD and AML.

These results indicate that the mutated AML1-ETO proteins were unable to appropriately regulate a subset of genes required for the development of AML.

To determine whether disrupting CBFß binding above a specific threshold results in functional impairment, we introduced mutations analogous to T161A and Y113A/T161A -LRB- T188A and Y140A/T188A -RRB- into TEL-AML1.

It appears that, as was the case for AML1-ETO, a decrease in CBFß binding from 60 - to 400-fold is accompanied by a progressive impairment in TEL-AML1 's clonogenic activity. 
0.66319153929 0.515039398354 1.09481 0.472840083222 33 5.50322198031 5.09534188629 

We are optimistic that targeted disruption of either function may provide an effective therapeutic modality.

The Runt domain-CBFß interface, on the other hand, contains a large hydrophobic area ,36,62 which should be more conducive for binding small molecules with drug-like properties. 
0.586017821156 0.495719854814 0.6363 0.647805695929 29 3.76343739935 4.10485881713 

Alternatively, combined therapies using inhibitors targeting other functions specific for AML1-ETO -LRB- eg, oligomerization 15,49,87 -RRB- may provide specificity.

We find it encouraging that both AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 rely on CBFß for their activity, and therefore a single compound may prove efficacious in both disease settings. 
0.730250189869 0.4545 0.7878 0.845003919413 29 3.61391857471 4.04406545788 

It has been suggested that much of AML1-ETO 's activity may be mediated in a manner that does not require binding to Runx-dependent promoters .13 
1.54079876805 1.89133842771 2.17022241379 4.48065472381 25 5.88677352224 8.3383897119 

Our data support the notion that some of AML1-ETO 's activity indeed does not require either DNA or CBFß binding, in that ectopic -LRB- retroviral -RRB- expression of a mutant defective in both functions could still significantly repress granulocyte differentiation of BM cells in vitro. 
1.26798543769 1.59556254725 1.1514 0.850386786787 47 6.83084714519 8.3999048048 

Modulation of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation may play a role in the regulation of HIV-1 latency and activation and links viral replication to the glucose metabolism of the host cell.

Hence, the establishment of a metabolic treatment might supplement the repertoire of antiretroviral therapies against AIDS.

The dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation has therefore been proposed to control protein-protein interactions and protein functions.

Thus, modulation of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation may be useful as a potential therapeutic approach for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.

To exclude the possibility that reduced HIV-1 gene transcription is caused by impaired nuclear transport of the preintegration complex or reduced proviral integration, we evaluated the impact of GlcN treatment on the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity. 
0.367258548428 0.792862002153 0.9999 0.400385117901 38 3.86788341493 3.35057525992 

Assuming that O-GlcNAcylation alters the activity of transcription factors, Sp1 and NF-κB were prime candidates for the O-GlcNAc-mediated inhibition of the HIV-1 LTR. 
0.417494638819 0.580762002153 0.6666 0.73850045616 25 4.42822920603 2.65617047567 

Since the presence of the Sp1-binding sites is crucial for the inhibitory effect of OGT on the HIV-1 LTR promoter, we investigated whether this is also the case for the Sp1 protein itself. 
1.34881289319 0.740626191861 0.8787 0.421589917514 35 5.60506831509 3.73304006036 

To investigate the role of Sp1 in the OGT-mediated inhibition of the HIV-1 LTR in more detail, we explored whether overexpression of OGT enhances O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 -LRB- Fig. 6A -RRB-. 
0.898896977001 0.792862002153 0.909 0.235349364664 33 5.76256299132 3.35493557088 

Furthermore, we evaluated by luciferase reporter assay whether the inhibitory effect of OGT on the Sp1-regulated HIV-1 LTR promoter is dose dependent.

The inhibitory effect of OGT on the HIV-1 LTR may rely on impaired nuclear translocation or decreased DNA-binding affinity of Sp1 upon O-GlcNAcylation. 
0.519814634839 0.606 0.6666 0.346021662918 24 2.80716120944 2.6225917335 

To investigate whether OGT interferes with the DNA-binding affinity of Sp1, gel shift assays were carried out with templates corresponding to the Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR promoter -LRB- Fig. 7B, wt LTR-Sp1 -RRB-. 
0.862490896169 0.8181 0.9999 0.522139395668 38 5.0463642377 5.24869841464 

Both antibodies shifted Sp1-C almost completely -LRB- Fig. 7D, lanes 4 and 7 -RRB-, suggesting that most of the DNA-bound Sp1 is O-GlcNAcylated in OGT-overexpressing cells.

Thus, we aimed to investigate whether increased OGT expression prior to infection may amplify the inhibitory effects on HIV-1 transcription in lymphocytes.

This effect appeared to be mediated by the transcription factor Sp1, as supported by several lines of experimental evidence. 
1.03082555324 0.342705635739 0.5454 0.506744416445 21 5.13164604015 2.05302499941 

These differential effects may depend not only on the individual composition of the transcription complexes at different promoters but also on differential Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation patterns in different transcription complexes. 
0.733111535116 0.550462002153 0.7878 1.38167220463 30 3.72096237841 3.5188684113 

The latter is supported by the fact that transcriptional corepressors recruit OGT to promoters -LRB- 78 -RRB-, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation is modulated directly at the promoter site. 
0.588293296931 0.5335940625 0.606 1.08947102516 29 4.53872251036 4.42722500919 

As O-GlcNAcylation appears to have a yin-yang relationship with phosphorylation, the same may apply for O-GlcNAcylation.

Several mechanisms have been suggested for how O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits promoter activity. 
1.43040769783 1.28553968254 1.33325 0.731849903368 14 3.22148366608 2.76488408678 

Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylated Sp1 seems to act additionally as a repressor of HIV-1 transcription, as the presence of the Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR is crucial for the inhibitory effect of OGT. 
0.898627829464 0.701962002153 0.909 0.694114485739 35 5.53181495191 5.01454360444 

The HIV-1 LTR promoter containing only functional NF-κB-binding sites but mutated Sp1-binding sites -LRB- LTR-κB-Sp1mut -RRB- was activated by OGT overexpression, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB increases the transcription rate from the LTR-κB-Sp1mut promoter. 
0.702801613829 0.8787 0.9999 0.480524336917 36 5.30952810078 4.3541697491 

Accordingly, O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB has been described and it was suggested to enhance the nuclear translocation of NF-κB -LRB- 21 -RRB-. 
1.20365717752 1.58920752262 1.705835 0.65354747479 23 4.50364849403 3.05957364146 

This indicates that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 LTR in a dominant manner.

Furthermore, the dominant effect of Sp1 over NF-κB might be attributed to the synergistic mode of action of both transcription factors on the HIV-1 LTR -LRB- 59, 60 -RRB-.

A potential molecular mechanism for the dominant repressive effect of O-GlcNAcylated Sp1 on the HIV-1 LTR relies on the ability of Sp1 to recruit corepressors to the promoter.

Thus, O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 might quickly put initiated viral replication into a state of latency.

Our results indicate that the O-GlcNAc level, and thus the glucose metabolism, may influence the life cycle of HIV-1.

Accordingly, inducers of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation such as GlcN and 2-deoxyglucose, which are approved in clinical treatment of osteoarthritis and human genital herpes infections, respectively -LRB- 3, 61 -RRB-, may support HAART.

A polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin -LRB- HTT -RRB- gene causes neurodegeneration in Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB-, but the in vivo function of the native protein -LRB- Htt -RRB- is largely unknown.

Although Htt is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, HD mainly affects medium-sized spiny neurons in the striatum and to a lesser extent cortical pyramidal neurons that project to the striatum, suggesting that other cellular factors also contribute to pathogenesis -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998 -RRB-.

Recent studies indicate that an alteration of wild-type Htt function might contribute to this specificity and to subsequent disease progression -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.

Furthermore, wild-type Htt is proposed to have a neuroprotective role as expression of Htt can protect cultured striatal neurons from stress - and toxin-mediated cell death -LRB- Rigamonti et al., 2000 -RRB-.

Conditional knockout of Hdh in the mouse forebrain at postnatal or late embryonic stages causes a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, lending support to the hypothesis that depletion of normal Htt activity during disease progression contributes to HD pathogenesis -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 2000 -RRB-. 
0.53866898407 0.9696 1.212 0.996405656604 46 5.31791271868 6.19608777035 

A more recent study in zebrafish, which used morpholino oligos to transiently knockdown endogenous Htt, suggests that Htt has a role in normal blood function and iron utilization -LRB- Lumsden et al., 2007 -RRB-.

Although further studies are needed to elucidate the structure of the Htt proteins, this rather remarkable similarity raises the possibility of a conserved secondary structure among Htt family proteins and that both human and Drosophila Htt proteins are composed largely of repeated HEAT motifs.

Together, these data indicate that dhtt is widely expressed at low levels during all stages of Drosophila development.

Since Htt homozygous knockout mice die during early embryogenesis -LRB- Duyao et al., 1995 ; Nasir et al., 1995 ; Zeitlin et al., 1995 -RRB-, we expected that loss of dhtt in the fly would be associated with prominent developmental defects.

To determine whether developmental defects are present in dhtt-ko animals, we characterized dhtt-ko mutants using a variety of cellular and neuronal markers. 
0.846331221982 1.3416504622 1.29215074468 0.604952251369 24 4.1540971517 2.28286709602 

The exact nature of this phenotype discrepancy is not clear.

The more severe phenotypes might also be the result of the non-specific RNAi off-target effects caused by the knockdown of unrelated genes -LRB- Kulkarni et al., 2006 -RRB-. 
0.78480800487 0.766931100247 0.857345 0.599228954242 30 4.08386501099 4.34500456336 

Nevertheless, our results suggest that dhtt is dispensable for normal Drosophila development. 
0.855006702553 0.2727 0.3636 0.1212 14 2.81839891553 1.14784 

These phenotypic differences are probably the result of differences in mouse and fly embryogenesis, as the early lethality of Htt-null mice is due to the function of Hdh in extraembryonic membranes, for which there are no equivalents in Drosophila -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 1998 -RRB- -LRB- see Discussion -RRB-. 
1.85981127746 1.11652888103 1.2306283871 1.91137504047 53 9.54108768601 9.62997906077 

To test whether dhtt plays a role in synapse organization, we examined the formation of glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions -LRB- NMJs -RRB- in third instar larvae, a well-characterized system for studying synapse formation and function in Drosophila -LRB- Budnik and Gramates, 1999 -RRB-.

Htt has also been proposed to regulate axonal vesicle transport because one of its binding partners, HAP1, interacts directly with p150Glued, which is an essential subunit of the dynactin complex involved in regulating dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport -LRB- Engelender et al., 1997 ; Gunawardena et al., 2003 ; Harjes and Wanker, 2003 -RRB-.

We next investigated whether dhtt might function in adult animals.

We examined whether newly emerged dhtt adults were hypersensitive to stress tests including prolonged heat and cold exposure, vortexing and feeding with the oxidative stress compound paraquat.

The observed mobility and viability phenotype could be because of an underlying neurotransmission defect in dhtt mutants as several proposed Htt functions, such as axonal vesicle transport and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neurons, are essential for the delivery and recycling of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals to ensure effective neurotransmission -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Eaton et al., 2002 ; Harjes and Wanker, 2003 ; Hinshaw, 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000 -RRB-.

Together, these data suggest that dhtt is not essential for neurotransmission. 
0.928341293153 0.257825810811 0.303 1.47469417647 13 2.95790870631 1.98843329412 

No change in the amplitude of PPF was observed in dhtt mutants, indicating that short-term plasticity is intact.

dhtt-ko mutants showed a more severe temperature-induced loss of phototransduction than control flies, suggesting that photoreceptors in aged dhtt-ko mutants were stress-sensitive compared with the controls. 
1.05540264786 0.5033328 0.7272 1.3817594774 28 4.62017296852 4.9944046566 

To assess whether phototransduction can be maintained under an elevated temperature in dhtt mutants, we performed ERG recordings at 37 ° C. 
0.720055276602 0.455380275862 0.606 0.475169963312 23 3.61275872789 3.88592104682 

Although dhtt mutants aged 1 -- 3 days displayed normal ERGs at both 20 ° C and 37 ° C, aged dhtt mutants displayed abnormal sensitivity to 37 ° C, with over 60 % of aged mutants losing light-induced phototransduction and the on/off transients at 37 ° C compared with only 20 % of control aged adults -LRB- Fig. 6E, F -RRB-, indicating an important role of dhtt in maintaining phototransduction under temperature-induced stress.

Given that aged dhtt mutant adults did not show additional motor defects when placed at 37 ° C, we hypothesize that the loss of photoreceptor depolarization found in ERG recordings reflects temperature-sensitive defects in the phototransduction cycle, rather than in synaptic transmission. 
0.529373799435 0.818124350282 1.1817 0.784676862048 45 6.03776478633 6.75680553365 

To rule out the possibility that this reduced complexity was because of the accelerated aging process or a secondary effect associated with the reduced mobility of dhtt-ko mutants, we examined the axonal termini of the A307-positive neurons in 83-day-old wild-type flies, as animals at this age are near the end of their life span and have severely reduced mobility. 
0.7690735496 1.186882625 1.5756 1.69508955723 62 8.83563067989 7.77253117787 

The exact nature behind such a difference remains to be clarified, but might represent subtle alterations in axonal transport of membrane proteins in aged neurons.

Further, existing evidence suggests that normal Htt activity can be inactivated by mechanisms such as abnormal sequestration into insoluble aggregates -LRB- Huang et al., 1998 ; Kazantsev et al., 1999 ; Narain et al., 1999 ; Preisinger et al., 1999 ; Wheeler et al., 2000 -RRB-.

However, we have a unique opportunity to examine this in Drosophila because dhtt is not essential for fly embryogenesis and dhtt mutants appear to behave normally at young ages, with only a mild axon terminal defect in the brain.

The clear separation, along the midline, between the pair of medially projected ß-lobes, which was obvious in HD-Q93 flies -LRB- Fig. 9C, white arrow -RRB- -LRB- supplementary material Figs S7 and S8 -RRB- -LRB- n = 14 -RRB- and wild-type flies -LRB- Fig. 7J -RRB-, also became less distinct and often appeared to be merged in HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies -LRB- n = 13/18 -RRB- -LRB- Fig. 9H, white arrow -RRB- -LRB- supplementary material Figs S7 and S8 -RRB-.

The results obtained from quantifying the brain size of these flies suggested that, although the overall size of the brains was similar between HD-Q93 and HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies -LRB- Fig. 9M -RRB- -LRB- average brain size : HD-Q93 = 119,279 ± 2015 µm2, n = 7 ; HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko = 115,389 ± 2412 µm2, n = 7 ; P = 0.003 -RRB-, the total area that was devoid of neuronal cells was increased by about 25 % -LRB- Fig. 9N -RRB- -LRB- total area devoid of neurons cells : HD-Q93 = 26,324 ± 1869 µm2, n = 7 ; HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko = 32,945 ± 2494 µm2, n = 7 ; P = 0.03 -RRB-.

Together, these results suggest that there is increased disorganization and an increase in neuronal loss in the brains of HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies. 
1.0528612655 0.713157172995 0.5757 0.799827010709 25 4.94573477687 4.39383331993 

As no other Htt homolog exists in the fly genome -LRB- Li et al., 1999 -RRB-, such a mild phenotype is unlikely to be caused by a functional redundancy resulting from another Htt-like gene in Drosophila. 
0.447622248322 0.494205635739 0.8484 0.618657581205 39 4.38786136564 6.18965682141 

However, this phenotypic discrepancy might also reflect intrinsic differences during mouse and fly embryogenesis. 
0.575813358556 0.393930292398 0.3939 0.244312033614 16 2.29438533374 1.03877700047 

It is probable that Drosophila does not require equivalent tissues, such as extraembryonic membranes, to support its early development and that its embryogenesis can proceed normally in the absence of dhtt. 
0.554788692318 0.752102440359 0.8181 0.727894391781 34 5.74291911863 5.78591547831 

The absence of an Htt homolog in C. elegans suggests that Htt does not have a function that is essential for the development of invertebrates in general, which is in agreement with our observation that dhtt is dispensable for normal development of Drosophila. 
1.39369718429 0.790286162054 1.0302 0.663537276514 45 8.83595405009 5.3918244731 

Interestingly, a phylogenetic comparison of Htt proteins from different species postulates that Htt in the protostome -LRB- which includes Drosophilids -RRB- might be dispensable because, when compared with the deuterostome branch, evolution of the Htt genes along the protostome branch is more heterogeneous -LRB- Tartari et al., 2008 -RRB-. 
1.57164968415 0.91486257078 1.515 1.17890080064 54 7.6961188943 9.02756507325 

Further studies will be required to determine whether the mammalian Htt gene can rescue Drosophila dhtt-null phenotypes.

Analyses of dhtt-ko mutants suggest that loss of dhtt does not affect synapse formation, neurotransmission or axonal transport -LRB- Figs 3 -- 6 -RRB-, which is in agreement with the absence of an Htt homolog in the worm, in which the essential components of these cellular processes are conserved. 
1.51282230686 0.737947162054 1.3029 1.164158444 53 8.00065204273 6.15712630412 

It is possible that Htt still regulates these cellular processes, but with a minor role. 
0.538135790304 0.556697465077 0.846554117647 2.60347746746 17 2.91818965692 4.54968983794 

Extrapolating, there is a possibility that the function of Htt is associated with a novel cellular process and/or animal function that has been acquired during evolution. 
0.478854393742 0.588913433075 0.667331428571 1.38713524845 28 4.62932143875 5.01807950858 

Compared to the worm, Drosophila has a relatively long life span, a more complex nervous system and a more active life cycle, raising an intriguing possibility that the function of Htt might be directly related to these higher functions in adult animals.

Targeted inactivation of Hdh in the mouse forebrain also causes a progressive neurodegeneration phenotype, suggesting that Hdh is required in the development and survival of neuronal cells -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 2000 -RRB-.

It remains to be determined whether common underlying molecular mechanisms are responsible for the observed brain phenotypes in the fly and mouse.

Nonetheless, considering the evolutionary distance between Drosophila and the mouse, the existence of structural defects in the adult brain in both species could indicate a conserved role of Htt in maintaining neuronal integrity. 
1.13313161826 0.659396818182 0.9393 0.567061945311 36 4.26298594223 4.69941753238 

Synapse complexity can be modulated by many factors, including neuronal activity and membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics.

In the future, many questions remain to be answered, such as the significance of this axonal terminal phenotype, the exact function of Htt in axonal termini complexity and the possibility of a causal link between this brain defect and the observed adult mobility and viability phenotypes. 
1.37347257136 2.24853509429 2.18169 0.710127708789 50 8.61827625978 5.48915867132 

Given that the distinctive neuronal loss observed in each polyQ disease is caused by otherwise unrelated disease genes that are widely expressed, it has been hypothesized that other cellular factors affect disease pathogenesis -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000 -RRB-. 
1.75232841602 1.90922857143 1.80657241379 3.58486201961 48 8.3661231235 9.74603000953 

When endogenous wild-type Hdh is replaced by yeast artificial chromosomes -LRB- YACs -RRB- containing full-length human Htt with an expanded polyQ tract -LRB- YAC46, YAC72 and YAC128 -RRB- -LRB- Leavitt et al., 2001 ; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005 -RRB-, the mice develop massive cell death in the testes that can be suppressed by the wild-type Hdh gene, suggesting that the normal function of Htt might mitigate the cellular toxicity associated with the polyQ-expanded mutant Htt protein -LRB- Leavitt et al., 2001 ; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005 -RRB-. 
2.51696916711 1.78858027586 2.4543 2.18265634077 97 12.1510250786 15.4016370552 

In addition, a genome-wide study of HD animal models and postmortem tissues has shown that neuronal genes regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF, including the gene encoding BDNF, could be similarly repressed by either the presence of the polyQ-expanded Htt protein or by depleting endogenous wild-type Htt -LRB- Zuccato et al., 2007 -RRB-. 
1.17232854883 1.12820354061 1.4241 0.98728436821 58 9.37400489112 8.32644737095 

Together, these and other studies support the hypothesis that loss of normal Htt function affects HD pathogenesis. 
0.458287139444 0.743193857143 0.3939 1.26521767033 19 2.77836101395 3.74168181847 

It should be noted that our results do not directly demonstrate that loss of the endogenous Htt protein specifically affects HD pathogenesis, because the enhanced pathology might be the result of an additive effect of two detrimental factors in the animals, namely the presence of a toxic polyQ tract and the disturbance of the normal function of Htt.

Although dhtt-ko mutants exhibit only a mild age-dependent adult phenotype, it is possible that, in the absence of endogenous dhtt, some undetected cellular defects might develop that render the animals more susceptible to other cellular attacks.

In the presence of a toxic polyQ tract, this vulnerability might be exposed further, leading to additive phenotypes.

Our result is in agreement with the early hypothesis that HD might be caused by the combination of an acquired toxicity, conferred by the expanded polyQ tract in the mutated Htt, and an incurred neuronal vulnerability, arising from the loss of endogenous Htt function -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.

Our data, together with previous mammalian studies, suggest that the normal function of Htt has a conserved neuroprotective role in the brain and that its depletion could render neuronal cells more vulnerable to the toxicity associated with the polyQ tract -LRB- Auerbach et al., 2001 ; Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Dragatsis et al., 2000 ; Leavitt et al., 2001 -RRB-.

Given the devastating consequence of fully progressed HD, together with the observations that Htt-null neurons can develop and survive in the adult mouse brain and that dhtt-ko animals are largely normal with only mild adult brain defects, our data indicate that the benefit gained from balanced administration of RNAi knockdown therapy in the adult brain might justify the relatively mild loss caused by depletion of the Htt-associated neuroprotective function.

After generating transgenic flies with this dhtt minigene rescue construct, we crossed these animals into the dhtt-ko mutant background to test whether the mobility and viability phenotypes of dhtt-ko mutants could be rescued.

Our preliminary studies indicate that tick RNAi pathways may differ from that of other Arthropods such as insects.

The understanding of gene function in a poorly studied Arthropod such as the cattle tick Rhipicephalus -LRB- Boophilus -RRB- microplus -LRB- subphylum Chelicerata : order Acari : suborder Ixodida -RRB- can benefit from the knowledge generated by genome-wide resources of the model insect Drosophila melanogaster -LRB- subphylum Mandibulata : order Hexapoda : suborder Insecta -RRB-.

An additional phenomenon identified in plants and C. elegans is the systemic spread of RNAi from cell to cell throughout the organism and its potential systemic transfer to subsequent generations through the germ-line -LSB- 29-31 -RSB-.

Proteins related to this phenomenon in C. elegans include Sid-1, which encodes a multi-transmembrane domain protein thought to act as a channel for dsRNA uptake, and RNAi spreading defective proteins -LRB- Rsd-2, Rsd-3 and Rsd-6 -RRB- shown to be required for the systemic RNAi response -LSB- 32,33 -RSB-.

Originally, systemic RNAi was thought to be unique to C. elegans in animals, however preliminary evidence suggests that silkworm, honeybee, wasp and beetle utilize a Sid-1-like -LRB- sil -RRB- protein not found in mosquitoes or flies -LRB- reviewed by Tomoyasu et al -LSB- 14 -RSB- -RRB-.

In this study we provide evidence for the presence of RNAi pathway associated proteins in R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genome reads, including a tick homologue for Dicer, Argonaute proteins, RdRP and proteins associated with dsRNA uptake and processing, and thus propose a putative tick RNAi pathway.

The R. microplus Ago-2 homologue TC984 -LRB- TC9244/TC16832, BmiGI2 -RRB- identified by de la Fuente et al -LSB- 37 -RSB- was also confirmed in our search and appears to encode a Piwi domain.

We identified putative hits to Rsd-3 and Epn-1 in both R. microplus and I. scapularis with 45 % and 48 % -LRB- Rsd-3 -RRB- and 71 % and 43 % -LRB- Epn-1 -RRB- identities, respectively.

It must be noted that only one SN domain was identified in the putative homologue which either indicates that it is not a true TudorSN homologue or that the consensus sequence is currently incomplete.

It is yet unconfirmed whether a SID-1 or Sil-1 homologue exist in ticks, however, it is feasible that RdRP and associated proteins are involved in germ-line spread similar to the C. elegans RdRP pathway -LSB- 28 -RSB-.

A definitive dsRNA binding protein -LRB- such as D. melanogaster R2D2 or C. elegans Rde-4 -RRB- potentially associated with Dicer was not found using the current tick sequence resources.

To validate further a putative functional RNAi pathway in R. microplus we conducted RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo.

Evaluation of the assigned functional information revealed that 5 sequences putatively have a role in ribosome and protein synthesis -LRB- TC5762, TC9037, TC12306, TC12372, TC12393 -RRB-, 4 in proteasome and ubiquitinylation -LRB- TC6372, TC9852, TC10417, TC13930 -RRB-, 3 in DNA binding -LRB- TC6116, TC12182, TC9417 -RRB-, and one in energy and metabolism -LRB- TC5823 -RRB-.

As the viscera from only one tick per treatment was harvested for RT-qPCR, it is feasible that the TC9037 treatment on this single tick was not delivered successfully, however, none of the 5 ticks injected produced viable eggs indicating a knockdown phenotype for the TC9037 treatment overall.

The lack of tick genome sequence resources has limited the ability to mine for RNAi protein homologues however research to date has suggested that ticks utilize a dsRNA-mediated RNAi similar to that described in insects such as flies and mosquitoes -LSB- 47,48 -RSB-.

De la Fuente and colleagues -LSB- 37 -RSB- postulated a model for tick dsRNA-mediated RNAi following the identification of a putative Ago-2 protein in the R. microplus EST database.

Our results support the diagram represented in de la Fuente et al -LSB- 37 -RSB- demonstrating evidence for putative tick Dicer, RISC associated proteins and dsRNA uptake homologues, however we identified a R. microplus EGO-1 homologue known to be implicated in RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity previously not identified in animals other than C. elegans.

To provide an evolutionary perspective to demonstrate relationships within the Ecdysozoan infraphylum it is important to note that their common ancestors may have existed over 1 billion years ago -LSB- 49 -RSB-.

Our preliminary evidence points to a ` single' tick Dicer with yet un-confirmed structure, though until complete tick genome resources are available the presence of more than one Dicer can not be entirely dismissed.

The functions of these tick Argonaute proteins remains to be confirmed and further research is required to identify the full complement of tick PPD proteins.

An additional aim of our study was to investigate whether fruit fly RNAi screens of conserved genes could be associated with similar tick phenotypes and tick gene function.

We used a stringent search to enable the selection of the most similar sequences to maximize the probability of selecting a tick sequence which following dsRNA mediated knockdown could also affect growth and viability in vitro.

It is also possible that the cell line types utilized in D. melanogaster and R. microplus are not directly comparable and functionally different.

The 438 genes targeted by Boutros and co-workers -LSB- 43 -RSB- compared the effects using 2 embryonic cell lines, Kc167 which is an ` early' embryonic cell line and S2R + which is a ` late' embryonic cell line -- potentially more comparable to BME26 cells which are ` late' embryonic in origin -LSB- 55-57 -RSB-.

Perhaps the fact that we chose highly conserved homologues increased the probability of success in our in vivo experiments compared with C. elegans.

However, it is clear that tick in vitro RNAi analysis using BME26 can not be directly correlated to available Drosophila in vitro data, unless perhaps only target genes with higher z scores -LRB- as demonstrated here for ubiquitin-63E -RRB- can be studied to increase the probability of a phenotype correlation.

Until complete annotated tick genome resources are available, false positive knockdown resulting from long dsRNA treatments and the specificity of -LRB- siRNAs -RRB- tick RNAi reagents can not be confirmed.

We utilized the existing R. microplus BmiGI2 database -LRB- 13,643 ESTs -RRB- and the I. scapularis genome reads to identify 31 putative tick RNAi proteins which confirmed the presence of a putative Dicer, RISC associated, dsRNA uptake and RdRP proteins in ticks and constructed a putative tick RNAi pathway.

This could either be attributed to transfection/uptake issues and/or a difference in cell types in the fly and tick embryonic cell lines.

Sequences with a similarity of at least 80 % and an e-value less than e1-50 were selected, conceptually translated and their putative function was further analyzed by assigning GO terms using InterProScan -LSB- 63,68,69 -RSB-.

Together our findings support the idea that axons are delivered to particular regions of the neuropile by their responses to systems of positional cues in each dimension. 
0.539522711343 0.547181002153 0.6969 1.51488169974 28 4.36814217794 5.89808547602 

This work revealed that there might be additional cues operating in a similar fashion in the dorso-ventral axis of the nerve cord.

Thus it is clear that there must be cues operating in the neuropile that deliver terminals to these specific destinations within the forming network. 
0.461924635228 0.533156840077 0.606 0.472396517241 25 4.03772552714 3.44847988506 

However, the neuropile is a 3-D structure and there must therefore be additional cues that determine the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior termination domains for each axonal and dendritic arbor.

Sensory terminals that are shifted experimentally along the medio-lateral axis of the neuropile maintain their characteristic dorso-ventral location in their new position, suggesting that the factor that determines this position may be a `` dorso-ventral '' patterning cue that is present at different positions in the medio-lateral axis.

The Plexin overexpression phenotypes suggested that their Sema ligands might act as cues to position the terminals of neurons along the dorso-ventral axis of the forming neuropile.

We conclude that the GABAergic interneurons are likely to be a significant source of Sema 1a in layer 1 and also in layer 3.

One possibility is that the recently described extensions of midline glial cells, the gliopodia -LSB- 30 -RSB-, might provide a vehicle by which high levels of Sema 2a are deployed across the developing neuropile.

Sema 1a appears to play a more important role in preventing termination in layer 1, followed by layer 3, and a minor role in preventing termination in layer 2.

We also assessed the potential roles of Sema 1a and Sema 2a in controlling the termination of class IV axons in the antero-posterior axis by analysing their projections in a top-down view of the neuropile in wild type and in sema 1a, sema 2a double mutants -LRB- Figure S7 -RRB-. 
0.921653615671 1.18676200215 1.4544 1.01843134997 52 8.34260860064 8.94208851095 

In top down view, class IV terminals do appear disorganized compared to wild type, but we assume this disorganization is a consequence of the major defects in growth and termination in the dorsoventral axis. 
0.489742322487 0.774466579693 1.10816666667 0.734255482165 37 5.08029692285 4.10914632834 

Thus Sema 1a and Sema 2a do not appear to play a major role in confining class IV terminals to the anterior portion of the segment. 
0.555580784889 1.53308735244 1.716866 0.369364352561 27 4.02224591621 3.72160678614 

Thus, rather than a requirement to act as a cue, the class IV mutant phenotypes could reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Sema 1a in the sensory neurons themselves.

We also asked whether restoration of Sema 2a expression in the midline glial cells using the single mindedGAL4 line in an otherwise sema 2a mutant background -LRB- sema 2a, UAS-sema 2a ; single-mindedGAL4, ppkeGFP -RRB- rescues the sema 2a mutant phenotype of class IV axons -LRB- see Figure S4 for details of these experiments -RRB-.

The experiments we describe suggest that both Sema 1a and Sema 2a are required as cues to confine class IV sensory axons to ventral neuropile. 
1.08636722856 0.5757 0.7272 0.5454 26 5.19780281876 5.16528 

Thus, a combination of Plexins could be required in ventrally projecting sensory neurons to exclude them from dorsal and central neuropile. 
0.399312107834 0.486841538462 0.5454 0.294180250894 23 3.40531436011 2.50835031508 

To show whether both Plexins are required to exclude the ventrally projecting sensory neurons from central and/or dorsal neuropile, we analysed the projection pattern of class IV axons in plex A and B mutants. 
0.723003372005 0.8787 0.9999 1.28617417949 36 4.86312999486 3.94733819231 

We also observed that embryos transheterozygous for plex B and either sema 1a -LRB- sema 1a / + ; plex B / + -RRB-, sema 2a -LRB- sema 2a / + ; plex B / + -RRB-, or plex A -LRB- plex B/plex A -RRB- all exhibit class IV termination phenotypes, indicating a genetic interaction between these mutations -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-.

To further test whether Plex B functions to prevent termination in regions with high Sema 1a levels we analysed the patterns of sensory terminals that overexpress Plex B in a sema 1a mutant -LRB- Figure S9 -RRB-. 
0.776207691424 0.7878 1.0302 0.685833392857 38 6.32934879362 5.00497185714 

A similar expansion is also observed in plex ADf -LRB- 4 -RRB- C3 mutants, indicating that Plex A function is required to prevent termination in regions with highest levels of Sema 1a -LRB- Figure S9C -RRB-. 
0.479923382786 0.763366451613 0.9696 0.888129827978 38 5.33692896881 4.45243302129 

To exclude -LRB- a -RRB- the possibility that plex A and B are required in the central targets of sensory neurons, in which case the mutant phenotypes might be a result of aberrations in normal target directed growth and -LRB- b -RRB- the possibility that Plex A and B are acting as guidance cues we restored their expression selectively to sensory neurons using the P0163 GAL4 driver. 
1.38741649763 1.1947411331 1.7271 1.90127988932 69 10.9123738123 11.5681724519 

In a system in which neither the axonal nor dendritic terminals are constrained by the cell bodies or by the position of entry of the main dendrite or axon trunk into the neuropile, we envisage that connectivity develops in stages with an initial phase in which growing axons and dendrites are both delivered to appropriate volumes of the neuropile, followed by a phase of targeted connection between appropriate pre - and postsynaptic partners. 
0.729842213563 1.37362400431 2.0301 1.69530626519 76 9.48995974319 10.6525085445 

A pattern of growth of this kind would resemble that seen in the developing olfactory system of the adult fly where coarse targeting to particular regions of the antennal lobe is followed by precise recognition and matching between axons and dendrites -LSB- 36 -RSB-, -LSB- 37 -RSB-. 
0.803656657084 0.960763121953 1.2423 1.21396702534 49 7.00483666788 8.18263687531 

Alternatively it may be that the mechanisms that pattern the growth of fibres representing a single modality such as olfaction are different from those required to organise the distribution of terminals within a highly heterogeneous network such as that seen in the VNC. 
1.22982562697 0.820634224601 1.06430181818 2.22791927375 44 8.62612303971 6.37331436473 

Our initial approach of using a misexpression screen targeted to all sensory axons was sufficient to reveal the existence of the Semas as putative cues in the dorso-ventral axis by showing that there were generalised redistributions of sensory endings in this axis when the cells concerned were forced to express either of the two Sema receptors, Plex A or Plex B. 
0.992266315735 1.45308462968 1.5756 0.615481958604 62 10.0537993409 6.05016155857 

In the developing Drosophila embryo selective overexpression of the putative receptors for Sema 1a and Sema 2a in sensory neurons acts in a predictable fashion to exclude sensory axons and terminals from those regions where the ligands are highly expressed : overexpression of Plex A excludes projections from high levels of Sema 1a expression in layers 1 and 3. 
0.832464805712 1.45946200215 1.6968 2.07595883744 60 8.4879306236 11.0789262375 

These findings suggest that Sema 2a and Sema 1a provide guidance cues to the growth cones of sensory neurons that express Plex A and Plex B. 
1.33580426885 0.6363 0.7272 1.76055957143 26 5.63229359598 5.66780885714 

This suggests that the growth cones of these cells are attracted towards to midline -LRB- we assume by Netrins -RRB- -LSB- 39 -RSB- as soon as they enter the CNS, but that entry and termination in the more dorsal region of the neuropile is prevented by high levels of Sema 1a in layer 1. 
1.31965690616 1.1089463004 1.4544 2.10569562521 56 9.67145156822 9.60933401166 

Loss of plex A appears to affect class IV terminals less strongly than loss of sema 1a. 
0.362653513968 0.4242 0.4848 0.277293777778 18 2.84114042467 2.48983789474 

High levels of Plex B signalling thus appear to be able to substitute for the absence of Plex A signalling and prevent expansion into regions with high Sema 1a levels. 
0.36201358151 0.463905635739 0.7272 0.958377116323 31 3.85675422491 4.57277054597 

Sema 1a and Sema 2a are unlikely to be the only cues that operate in the dorso-ventral axis. 
0.264029290989 0.312406938855 0.445623043478 0.343645773907 19 3.27919585092 3.0409987504 

There may be long range ventral attractants or local substrate bound attractive cues for these axons in the neuropile. 
0.827798635406 0.423722311558 0.5151 4.81808494675 20 3.28391701587 8.22462064822 

Such signals could be the other Semas. 
0.266430694123 0.186715486739 0.1212 0.368742857143 8 1.05081674544 0.882062857143 

Alternatively, by analogy with the optic tectum, where Wnt signalling drives dorsal projections and Ephrins dictate ventral projections, it is possible that some other signalling system may operate with Semas to confine dorsally projecting neurons to dorsal neuropile -LSB- 3 -RSB-, -LSB- 40 -RSB-, -LSB- 41 -RSB-. 
1.62984792242 2.43539746508 1.96765411765 2.71751348413 53 6.1153240859 10.9933474523 

Thus, there appear to be two kinds of positional cues in the neuropile. 
0.466922673914 0.297053413517 0.3333 0.331166619084 15 2.90411725602 3.03272547337 

Slit and Sema 2a are examples of secreted and possibly glia-mediated positional cues. 
1.00197953786 0.2727 0.3333 0.728999629629 14 3.04885272587 2.84312990741 

Thus, the presentation of repellent molecules on the surfaces of subsets of neurons can act to exclude specific classes of axons from particular regions of the neuropile. 
0.474118238075 0.580762002153 0.7575 0.528489813856 29 3.46987971744 3.23676196928 

Although the evidence we provide here suggests that positional cues can specify particular domains for the termination of sensory neurons, we do not suppose that the control of termination and branching by a pervasive system of positional cues would necessarily be sufficient to allow connections to form selectively and specifically between appropriate pre - and postsynaptic partners. 
1.54655858512 1.18172435028 1.6362 2.09642433639 59 8.26203957166 10.1955511965 

Within these restricted regions it is likely that further, localised mechanisms, including competitive interactions, patterns of activity, and target derived cues might all be required to control synaptogenesis and determine the emergence of precise patterns of connectivity within a termination domain. 
1.4412756628 0.975984840077 1.54931 2.30851943115 46 6.68966218061 7.44122398193 

Thus, the position of termination in the neuropile does not seem to depend on the nerve through which the sensory neurons travel towards the neuropile nor on the position of entry into the neuropile. 
0.647445363833 0.515124350282 0.8484 0.514280895008 36 4.82116824363 3.41694253135 

Thus Sema 1a is unlikely to provide instructive information for controlling neurite termination along this axis. 
0.186285951116 0.3333 0.4242 0.268666581577 17 2.51734202068 2.79748003279 

These structures are thicker than the axon itself and we assume they contain presynaptic specialisations. 
0.276941438491 0.303 0.4242 0.616246428572 16 2.81723584024 3.340642 

We assessed the potential role of Sema 1a and Sema 2a in controlling termination of class IV axons in the antero-posterior axis by analysing their projections in a top-down view of the neuropile in wild type and in sema 1a, sema 2a double mutants -LRB- see Figure S5A and S5B -RRB-. 
0.958948755431 1.27766200215 1.515 0.775338701379 53 9.05420943714 8.68693834528 

We assume the observed disorganization is a consequence of the major defects in growth and termination in the dorsoventral axis. 
0.23538602038 0.471466579693 0.653666666667 0.278818815498 21 2.84390113154 2.37040966167 

Thus Sema 1a and Sema 2a do not appear to play a major role in confining class IV terminals to the anterior portion of the segment. -LRB- 1.15 MB TIF -RRB- 
0.616180784889 1.65428735244 1.868366 0.547283087924 32 4.59616591621 5.17654449106 

Plex B may therefore function as a receptor for Sema 1a. 
0.314303507996 0.2727 0.2727 0.301164068915 12 1.54731056271 0.91680558081 

Comparative analysis of evolutionary changes in distant organisms at the level of gene expression requires cross-matching -LRB- alignment -RRB- of temporal microarray data covering developmental time courses or cell cycles. 
0.353213451644 0.6363 0.8484 0.769072128473 31 2.64571168308 4.47199379926 

In addition, aligned temporal datasets can reveal concordantly and discordantly expressed pairs of orthologous genes or groups of genes. 
0.425596577618 0.398055555556 0.5151 0.959015045543 21 2.74690010231 3.84562551404 

Our analysis suggested that evolutionary shifts in durations of G1/G2 cell cycle phases are manifested in the expression timing of replication machinery and ribosomal genes. 
1.02869167141 0.5454 0.7272 0.63660199235 26 3.69285039686 1.86747706139 

Based on the amplitude of gene expression in the course of the life cycle, all genes in the yeast genome can be conditionally separated into -LRB- i -RRB- cell-cycle dependent -LRB- oscillating -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- constitutively expressed and -LRB- iii -RRB- inducible -LRB- not expressed or expressed constitutively in our datasets -RRB-. 
0.650835254723 1.00584227801 1.4544 1.38686284031 55 5.03759789523 11.3472410382 

Low oscillating and constitutive genes contribute less or no information to the global alignment, moreover, their actual expression dynamics can be masked by the internal noise. 
0.315021776336 0.546280275862 0.7878 0.398615781404 29 3.04356630032 4.1154879432 

However, several factors, such as biased contribution of synchronization approaches, short duration of the datasets -LRB- two cell cycles -RRB- and high internal noise can make Fourier analysis fail for many genes, which, in fact, do cycle significantly. 
1.43469755149 0.823192294551 1.0908 1.22079573071 45 6.19425608024 7.39204025041 

Statistical model for SNR takes into account assumption that periodically expressed genes would gradually increase or decrease expression level from one time point to another.

The SNR filtering reduced the initial number of the orthologous profile pairs in the selected datasets -LRB- α-factor - S. cerevisiae vs. cdc25 - S. pombe -RRB- to 3193 or otherwise to 2518 genes in S. pombe and 2169 genes in S. cerevisiae -LRB- see ortholog matching in Methods -RRB-.

An apparent contradiction between the previously reported number of cycling genes -LRB- 500 -RRB- -LSB- 18 -RSB- and the number of genes investigated in this study -LRB- > 2000 -RRB- is explained by the fact that all significantly changing profiles -LRB- high variance -RRB- were scored in our study, even if they displayed moderate Fourier power at the desired period -LSB- see Additional file 1 - Figure S5 -RSB-. 
2.67792878301 1.51031270321 1.7877 1.71475887523 71 10.0032092281 10.5247369615 

Synchronization between the replication machinery, ribosomal and housekeeping genes suggests coordination between the cell division and the cell growth -LSB- 22 -RSB- in both yeast species. 
1.02794702779 0.5454 0.7878 0.250121538462 28 3.27351551273 2.36760307692 

Such desynchronization or heterochrony observed between the mitochondrial and the ribosomal/replication genes can be attributed to the semi-autonomy of mitochondria and the mitochondrial gene expression -LSB- 23 -RSB-. 
0.512048265612 0.606880275862 0.7575 0.462539913949 29 4.83452415976 1.94642862772 

Apparently, since then, some of the mitochondrial pathways -LRB- respiration, ribosome biogenesis -RRB- maintained their own, internal, synchronization of gene expression. 
1.01983132443 1.12622260821 1.25459230769 1.60645377778 27 3.54443060858 5.35895789474 

Phase shift in expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial ribosomal genes detected in this study -LRB- see Figure 3G-J -RRB- appears to support hypothesis of decoupling of oxidative and reductive biochemical pathways in the yeast cell cycle -LSB- 26,27 -RSB-, and possibly represents an example of heterochrony -LSB- 28 -RSB- at the level of gene expression. 
1.66481640548 1.194611 1.515 1.70443724466 57 8.66014468236 5.85346243015 

In this work, comparative analysis of gene expression dynamics has shown that parts of large gene networks -LRB- presumably corresponding to time-clusters -RRB- maintained substantial temporal synchrony in the course of evolution.

One possible reason for this is the dramatic rewiring of regulatory pathways during evolution.

The following factors may limit the area of application : -LRB- i -RRB- variability in gene expression under different experimental conditions -LRB- synchronization method, -LSB- see Additional file 1 - Figure S10 and Table S2 -RSB- ; -LRB- ii -RRB- strikingly different alternative alignment paths, specific to large group of genes -LRB- heterochrony, see Figure 3 -RRB- ; -LRB- iii -RRB- distortion of gene expression profiles as the result of normalization and Gaussian smoothing.

Upsampling is a standard way of converting analog signals to digital, new sample rate should be at least 2 × higher than the highest frequency in the original signal -LRB- Nyquist - Shannon sampling theorem -RRB-.

Gaussian filter was used to remove high frequencies, much higher than frequencies related to the cell cycle, assuming that the high frequencies are noise.

Together, upsampling and Gaussian filtering might have effects similar to the interpolated time warping described earlier -LSB- 1 -RSB-.

Some studies -LRB- e.g., -LSB- 34,35 -RSB- -RRB- have shown that, to a certain extent, general language resources can also be useful in the training of SRLs for biomedical texts, due to the fact that many verbs appear in texts from both the general language and biomedical domains, and often behave in similar ways. 
2.46928325169 1.46966654339 1.3029 1.79374635855 60 9.01532768121 7.24368908577 

However, the cited works concede that, whilst such SRLs may produce adequate results for certain predicates, training using biomedical corpora is also needed.

Although their application to general language may be problematic -LSB- 30 -RSB-, the use of a closed set is viable in a restricted domain, as domain-specific definitions can be provided for each semantic role type. 
0.986809078899 0.576247928329 0.9696 0.507953732347 38 4.44043072089 4.47270872647 

The values of the semantic roles may be specified either as specific words or phrases -LRB- e.g., E. coli or NifA -RRB- or more general named entity categories -LRB- e.g., GENE -RRB-. 
0.508195816884 0.640884313711 0.8787 1.23037405565 35 2.76346371723 7.26584704293 

A further direction of research which could help to improve the performance of IE systems trained on the GREC is introduced in -LSB- 46 -RSB-, in which it is demonstrated that, due to the differing perspectives of different annotation schemes, it is not always the case that larger corpora contain the most useful information. 
1.71973803697 1.57154095649 1.61440712121 2.40489910945 58 9.22461936769 10.0861539463 

This provides convincing evidence that combining smaller, richly annotated corpora, such as our own, with larger corpora which are slightly poorer in information content, could provide a future direction of research for training more accurate biomedical IE systems.

This idea is especially attractive, given that the production of large, richly annotated corpora can be very time consuming.

For each event, two types of information may be specified in the text, both of which are important to its correct interpretation :

The current annotation effort is concerned with events relating only to gene regulation or expression, i.e., events that describe any interaction which leads, either directly or indirectly, to the production of a protein.

Annotators were helped by -LRB- but not restricted to -RRB- a list of verbs which we created that potentially denote gene regulation and expression events.

The automatic extraction was carried out by identifying those verbs whose syntactic arguments corresponded either to terms identified by the TerMine tool -LRB- http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/ -RRB- or biological named entities identified by the GENIA tagger -LSB- 55 -RSB-.

We concluded that arguments of gene regulation and expression events may be characterised using a subset of these general language roles, with the addition of the domain-specific CONDITION role.

For our own purposes, we created 2 separate roles, DESCRIPTIVE-AGENT and DESCRIPTIVE-THEME, and extended the characterisation of these roles to apply not only to predicatives, but also to any argument which describes characteristics or behaviour of either the AGENT or the THEME of the event. 
0.694241731337 0.74275366882 1.3332 0.779513786705 50 6.48946315829 5.44692940161 

The aim of this is to allow queries over extracted event instances to be performed at different levels of granularity, i.e., users could specify more general or less general concept types according to their requirements.

The AGENT of encoded may be viewed as any of the following spans : Klebsiella rcsA, Klebsiella rcsA gene, or The Klebsiella rcsA gene. 
0.680504003717 0.78365370765 0.827045 0.734242890517 27 3.90769753882 3.60757179453 

Similarly, the THEME could be polypeptide, a polypeptide or a polypeptide of 23 kDa.

This means that, for example, in the above sentence, the AGENT of encoded should be chosen as The Klebsiella rcsA gene, as this corresponds to a complete NP chunk. 
0.36623310267 0.393968456376 0.7272 0.32059507297 34 5.28187637012 3.48260157426 

Linguistic expertise would be acquired through the training programme and through study of the annotation guidelines.

When the species referred to in the abstract was changed -LRB- from E. coli to human -RRB-, this resulted in a drop in agreement rates for most tasks, particularly bio-concept assignment, suggesting that a period of adjustment is required when switching to a new species. 
1.81286236137 0.678332933649 1.212 1.33116008139 49 8.23792951629 9.43720844829 

Two tasks, however, i.e., semantic role assignment and argument identification, seem more domain-independent, in that the agreement rates stayed constant, or even continued to rise slightly, when the species referred to in the text was changed. 
0.882130118076 0.680376308132 0.974117755102 0.8484 44 5.09405651291 8.03488 

Differing levels of experience in gene regulation may have caused annotators to vary in their ability to accurately assign fine-grained biological concept categories. 
0.531176082953 0.432372368421 0.6363 0.773964281266 24 3.65999351801 3.76805970792 

In other cases, there appears to be a stronger preference for either the verb or the nominalised verb. 
0.686915396177 0.221692213279 0.4242 0.469150810811 20 2.66933832751 3.75995810811 

However, the fact that the Underspecified role was only assigned 11 times in the whole corpus suggests that our originally-defined role set is sufficient to characterise the vast majority of semantic arguments. 
1.21810123081 0.737130247755 0.85531 0.578766727772 34 5.27386413455 3.69223263156 

Whilst it may seem surprising that only about half of the events specify an AGENT, this can partly be explained by the relatively high occurrence of events that are centred on nominalised verbs -LRB- 42 % of all events -RRB- and passive constructions -LRB- 14 % of events -RRB-. 
2.21613936191 0.861148415196 1.3332 1.36584245273 51 8.59269351842 8.61446096989 

This suggests that more specific concept type assignment for genes can be problematic.

Thus, there may be a need to more carefully balance conciseness with comprehensiveness in the guidelines. 
0.481089019699 0.242108889098 0.3636 0.479446548263 18 2.51641610415 3.21546160547 

A particular example is the word mutation, which can be used either as a nominalised verb -LRB- i.e., the action of mutating -RRB-, or as an entity -LRB- e.g., a mutated gene -RRB-. 
0.318319889263 0.368824912312 0.8181 1.64102632465 38 3.83925367991 7.28381411664 

However, the distinction can sometimes be problematic. 
0.618644193328 0.334266959064 0.1212 0.165793913312 9 1.83851089478 0.560521609908 

In sentence 1 -RRB-, a particular envZ mutation seems to describe a mutated entity rather than the action of mutation.

In the following sentence, Alpha interferon should be seen as the AGENT of converting as well as the AGENT of stimulates :

LOCATION arguments can also be problematic in sentences containing multiple events. 
0.59230914875 0.349239607843 0.2727 0.0909 12 1.80578243674 0.86088 

The confusion may occur because anaerobic can be used in the description of environmental conditions in a phrase such as under anaerobic conditions. 
0.519082426072 0.247623609195 0.5757 0.871571300404 24 3.65538541133 4.63292445092 

Whilst this would normally be interpreted as a CONDITION, the confusion may have arisen due to the use of when at the beginning of the phrase. 
0.554375207085 0.247462002153 0.4545 0.481307264974 28 3.96339680136 3.29786567606 

According to the guidelines, one of the situations in which DESCRIPTIVE-THEME should be assigned is to objects of verbs that describe states rather than actions e.g., The fru operon contains the genes for IIFru. 
0.752837684468 0.947948356249 1.2955475 1.82312366102 37 6.2737175303 8.03334336158 

However, problems sometimes arose for certain verbs such as exhibit, where there may be some confusion as to whether a `` state '' or `` active '' interpretation should be taken, e.g., The wild-type and mutant ompR genes exhibit different phenotypes of osmoregulation ... 
2.44671961304 1.54781934999 1.2423 1.22275404855 48 9.48320598202 7.93111317819 

The interpretation taken by the annotator determines whether different phenotypes is assigned the role THEME or DESCRIPTIVE-THEME -LRB- and also whether The wild-type and mutant ompR genes is assigned AGENT or THEME -RRB-. 
1.29838329902 1.136755 0.9393 0.38514951406 34 5.68442844656 3.07249458845 

This, together with the fact that they are not particularly commonly occurring, could have made them more difficult to assign accurately. 
0.662388696598 0.306665310811 0.3939 0.465531376812 24 4.522379505 4.53977733696 

This may be related to their differing levels of knowledge regarding gene regulation and expression. 
0.703842506165 0.251271072242 0.3333 0.776578095238 16 2.40349707292 3.91225857143 

A solution for further phases of annotation would be to analyze the domain knowledge of annotators in greater detail and, where appropriate, provide extra training in the assignment of more specific categories. 
0.44168264011 0.578867619048 0.9696 0.515748929794 35 4.15110310584 4.01727738679 

This may be combined with a re-evaluation and possible simplification of the concept hierarchies. 
0.598220896275 0.339511535933 0.2424 0.837660634523 15 2.23012439171 2.31870376547 

Putatively functional motif occurrences are mapped onto a representative domain, given that a high quality reference SCOP domain structure is available for the protein itself or a close relative.

Although classification tools can not definitely confirm a motif as functional -LRB- only experimental analysis can achieve this -RRB- they can be used to attach a level of confidence to a motif.

It also indicates less likely matches that lie within globular domains annotated in the SMART -LSB- 26 -RSB- and Pfam -LSB- 27 -RSB- resources and contrasts these with intrinsically unstructured polypeptide -LRB- IUP -RRB- regions predicted by GlobPlot -LSB- 28 -RSB- that are more likely to be motif-rich -LSB- 5 -RSB-.

This observation suggests that stringent examination of motif structural context should be an essential processing step for experimental analysis.

It also advocates the importance of high quality tools to identify such cases, as the cost associated with failure is detrimental both in terms of effort and quality of the literature.

In this way, the new filter can aid researchers to decide whether they wish to invest effort inexperimentaltesting of candidate motifs.

In particular, since having high accessibility and belonging to loop regions is not a prerogative of LMs alone and the random match dataset might in principle be `` contaminated '' by not yet annotated spurious true motifs, we suggest using as many indicators as possible in evaluating a prediction score and not relying on each single tool as a unique criterion for retaining/rejecting a prediction. 
2.49327256049 1.66951581081 1.8483 2.26477428276 68 10.0309842662 11.3238200855 

In order to establish if one score is more discriminative than the others, we assigned an accessibility score -LRB- Qacc -RRB-, a secondary structure score -LRB- Qsse -RRB- and a combined score -LRB- Qand = Qacc + Qsse -RRB- to the true positive instances of our dataset and to the random matches of the random dataset, plotted cumulative score distributions and ROC curves and calculated the area under the ROC curves -LRB- AUCs -RRB-. 
1.07597035087 1.62794319269 2.0301 1.95109361816 78 8.05808415386 9.98354000674 

In calculating the ROC curves, we assumed that random matches are all negative matches. 
0.130795760973 0.2424 0.4242 0.942276190476 16 1.4891146128 2.23254444444 

This p-value, which is implemented both in the Web Server and in the Web Service, is calculated using a Z-test and is a conservative estimate of the probability that a LM prediction with a given score is a true positive ; more specifically it is the probability of obtaining a random match with a score at least as high as the one that was actually observed, and therefore we expect it to be very stringent. 
1.81662434495 1.11612688322 1.8483 1.01659053448 79 12.3657903898 9.97132791412 

In fact it is based on the idea that a predicted match that is assigned a score in the `` enriched '' interval will be indicated by our procedure as a good true motif candidate -LRB- i.e. likely to be a valid functional site -RRB-, motif matches scoring in the bottom interval -LRB- `` sparse '' interval -RRB- as unlikely to be valid functional sites and those ranking in the middle one as `` neutral ''. 
1.6991920088 1.95926543608 1.9695 3.62931827251 78 8.56684506658 13.8427391756 

From Figure 4 and Table 3, it can be seen that, in the case of the accessibility score -LRB- Figure 4a -RRB-, the cut-off on the top 30 % of true motifs implies that only 10 % of random matches are retained in the enriched bin and that the cut-off on the lower 40 % random matches implies that only 15 % true motifs incorrectly fall in the `` sparse '' bin. 
1.28448382262 1.57184042906 1.88280272727 1.69689786055 76 8.967164924 10.361577752 

In evaluating Sn, Sp and Accuracy, we assumed that a match belonging to the negative set and scoring above the `` accept '' threshold, is a FP and one scoring below, is a TN ; a true instance scoring above the `` accept '' threshold is a TP and one scoring below is a FN. 
1.07577237214 1.12371980414 1.6362 1.15560272727 60 6.67884531589 10.7021418182 

This observation is biologically sound since, while a buried motif is unlikely to be a genuine functional site, an exposed motif lying e.g. on a helix can in any case possess an interaction ability. 
0.585523187836 0.585292213279 0.9393 1.81791597775 37 3.33969109482 7.76584933902 

In deciding if a prediction is a good experimental candidate, the user should give more weight to accessibility score than to secondary structure score since a buried motif is unlikely to carry a function, whereas an exposed motif may function properly even if it is part of a beta strand or belongs to a helix -LRB- see examples in the benchmarking dataset, additional file 6 -LRB- Table S1 -RRB-. 
1.58641025964 1.4937064949 1.818 1.01471836043 73 9.47749256516 9.54063188374 

If there is evidence of allostery, however, depending on which parts of the structure are flexible, this might support or invalidate the motif. 
1.01738040657 0.437243619341 0.561256872749 0.502536509009 27 5.01175462052 4.69423436937 

LMs may be bound to their ligands or in an unliganded state.

The dependency of LM accessibility on globular domain rearrangements implies that multi-domain structures are not a suitable structural unit for structure filtering.

The appropriate units therefore in the cases of LMs would be the individual globular domains themselves.

In this sense, we encourage the user to carefully evaluate the possibility that a hidden motif can become exposed upon protein interaction and to use the ELM structure filter cum grano salis, i.e. not as a deterministic predictor but rather by exploiting the supplied 3D information on LM predictions as a supplement to a prior knowledge of the LM biological context.

We investigated this approach and concluded that it would currently be applicable only to the very few LMs that have enough instances in the database. 
0.654836177337 0.502942205128 0.5454 1.85138767605 26 4.42150364783 6.69844433712 

For the great majority of LMs, appropriate training and tests can not be carried out and predictions turned out to be unacceptably stringent : An effective procedure should be based on many more instances per LM and these are not available at the moment. 
1.53257364583 0.778557813469 1.038098125 1.07140644656 46 6.69407667556 8.00544739917 

We believe that in the future, as an increasing number of protein structures become available and the quantity of ELM annotation data grows, it will be possible to appropriately train and test motif-specific structure filters for a significant number of LMs. 
1.85281151012 2.39368651571 3.83345125 1.3030557366 44 7.89252933784 6.38965733984 

Whenever a query can be modelled on a structure, the structure filter can help in discriminating true from false positive matches of LMs.
