4269 The presence of hummocky, radar-bright crater ejecta crossing the radar-dark floor terrace and adjacent outer rim scarp suggests that the floor terrace is probably a giant rotated block that is concentric to, but lies outside of, the original crater cavity.
4271 To the southeast of the crater rim, emplacement of hummocky ejecta appears to have been impeded by the topography of preexisting ridges, thus suggesting a very low ground-hugging mode of deposition for this material.

4294 If the membrane receptors are altered directly or deficient for some reason, the signal transduction can be hindered and cause diseases.
4295 Some diseases are caused by membrane receptor function disorder due to deficiency or disorder of the receptor induced by the change in the genes that encode the receptor protein.
4297 Also, when the cell is infected by nonenveloped virus, the virus first binds with certain membrane receptors and then somehow the virus or some subviral component ends up on the cytoplasmic side of a cellular membrane, the plasma membrane for some viruses or the membrane of an endosomal vesicle for others.
4298 In the case of poliovirus, it is known that interactions with receptors in vitro will lead to conformational rearrangements of the virion that result in the release of one of the virion proteins, called VP4.
4300 It is proposed that the conformational changes induced by receptor binding result in the insertion of the myristic acid on VP4 into the cell membrane and the formation of a channel through which the RNA can enter the cell.
4301 Minnie lived to see her reputation revive in the 1960s as part of the general revival of interest in the blues.

4329 There are many theories about this.
4331 Here are some of these in no particular order.
4334 His role is Nate 's always assigned the most ridiculous tasks, from fluffing Zak 's shag rugs to re-recording his outgoing voicemail message.
4335 He 's determined to impress Zak and climb higher on the food chain, but Nate sometimes tries too hard to please -- especially with the ladies.
4339 He is also notable for spending seven years in supporting roles under contract to three major studios at once : MGM, Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox.
4340 He considers his best performances the role he played in `` Killer Instinct '' on the television program `` Desilu Playhouse '', along with his roles in the movies `` Westbound '', `` Winterhawk '' and `` Seven Thieves ''.
4342 While at CAA, he was responsible for pioneering the practice of `` packaging '' writers, directors, and actors for motion pictures.
4343 This practice led to CAA and its clients holding significant negotiating leverage over the major studios.
4344 Various industry critics, such as entertainment-securities attorney John Cones in his recent book, Hollywood Wars, maintain that the practice of packaging is an illegal tie-in prohibited by federal and state antitrust laws.
4346 He composed many concertos, notably 25 ` concertos comiques.'.
4355 It has also been suggested that there are two schools of thought among the Republic 's Jedi.
4357 On the other hand, Yoda 's school, which is the dominant school in the Jedi Council, would state that the Force is purely a mystical interconnection between all things -LRB- `` Here, between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere ! Yes, even between this land and that ship ! '' he teaches Luke in ` Episode V' -RRB- and that midi-chlorians are at most a consequence of the ability with the Force, hence the reliance of the Council on true tests of Anakin 's ability with the Force, even though Qui-Gon has certified the large number of midi-chlorians in his blood.
4358 Yoda 's school does have some support for Midi-chlorians being merely the biological way of describing the mystical force because despite the high midi-chlorian count Anakin turned to the dark side failing in the test of mind.
4359 It is already known that Qui-Gon is a pariah among the Jedi, so it would n't be surprising if he had a slightly different view of the Force than the dominant theory.
4360 However, if this were the case, it could be expected that Qui-Gon 's apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, would subscribe to his master 's school of thought.
4366 They were never mentioned in the original trilogy, and many fans believed they diluted the spiritual aspect of ` Star Wars' by making the connection to the Force biological rather than mystical.
4367 However, it may have already been established in the original trilogy that the Force was genetic -LRB- through heredity -RRB- and passed down through families.
4368 Some argue that this was intentionally jarring ; a way to imply that the Jedi Order of the time had become so bureaucratic that even one 's potential in the ways of the Force was measured by a single statistic.
4369 Indeed, it would be only after the events of ` Episode III' that one sees surviving Jedi explaining the Force in mythical terms, although Lucas insists that midi-chlorians were not mentioned in the original trilogy simply because he did not `` get around to it '' -LRB- Episode 1 commentary -RRB-.
4371 During his tenure as the show 's host, Nelson terminated the invention exchanges -LRB- last exchange during episode 519, Outlaw -RRB- and letter readings -LRB- episode 705, Escape 2000 -RRB- that were a staple of the show 's first five years, ending some popular traditions but giving the writers much more freedom in creating the opening and closing sketches.

4381 Milk contains casein, a substance that breaks down in the human stomach to produce the peptide casomorphin, an opioid that appears to act as a histamine releaser, and is suspected in some cases to aggravate the symptoms of autism.
4383 Milk that has not received a fat content reduction is rich in saturated fat and cholesterol, which numerous sources have suggested as contributing to an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease when consumed in excessive quantity.
4387 There are some fringe groups debating the amount of calcium from milk that is actually absorbed by the human body.
4390 Several studies have shown that men who drink large amount of milk and consume dairy products may increase their risk of developing Parkinson 's disease.
4391 The reason behind this is, however, not fully understood and it also remains unclear why this is not the case for women.
4392 Several sources suggest a correlation between high calcium intake -LRB- 2000 mg per day, or twice the US recommended daily allowance, equivalent to six or more glasses of milk per day -RRB- and prostate cancer.
4394 A review published by the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research states that at least eleven human population studies have linked excessive dairy product consumption and prostate cancer, however randomized clinical trial data with appropriate controls only exists for calcium, not dairy produce, where there was no correlation.
4402 It can also be argued that the MIST is a more objective test of intelligence than the Turing test, a subjective assessment that some might consider to be more a measure of the interrogator 's gullibility than of the machine 's intelligence.
4403 According to this argument, a human 's judgment of a Turing test is vulnerable to the ELIZA effect, a tendency to mistake superficial signs of intelligence for the real thing, anthropomorphizing the program.
4404 The response, suggested by Alan Turing 's essay `` Can Machines Think ? '', is that if a program is a convincing imitation of an intelligent being, it is in fact intelligent.
4412 It is believed that these movies were cut to better transition the story between ` SEED' and ` Gundam SEED Destiny'.
4413 Others believe also that the special editions were made to correct or add things that were not in the TV series due to time or budget reasons.
4414 It has been mistakenly referred to that these are in fact recap episodes.
4416 The series first premiered in Japan on the terrestrial MBS and TBS networks, where it occupied the Saturday 6 p.m. timeslot, widely considered a prime timeslot ; the anime and its subsequent successor to the timeslot -LRB- Fullmetal Alchemist -RRB- went on to do very well.

4421 But since the world of prostitution is in the shadows in America and most of the world, it is an easy area to harvest this enterprise into a huge cash cow.
4427 Less controversially, many would agree that the first signs of modernity were certainly in Machiavelli 's lifetime, which was also the time of Martin Luther, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the Borgia popes, Amerigo Vespucci, Leonardo da Vinci, and Henrys VII and VIII of England.
4428 Machiavelli 's political writings are surprisingly open in their criticism of the traditional division of power which existed in Europe, especially Italy, between the Roman Catholic Church and secular government, which was still centered around the Holy Roman Emperor.
4441 Monopropellants are not as efficient as some other propulsion technologies.
4446 ` Moral absolutism' is the belief that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged, and that certain actions are right or wrong, devoid of the context of the act.
4447 `` Absolutism '' is often philosophically contrasted with moral relativism, which is a belief that moral truths are relative to social, cultural, historical or personal references, and to situational ethics, which holds that the morality of an act depends on the context of the act.

4459 Critics argue that this page is compromised by weasel words.
4477 The globally integrated enterprise, which some see as the next development in the evolution of the multinational, does away with this requirement.

4487 The Terrible Towel has gained much popularity since its invention and `` is arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team ''.
4489 Some have advanced the hypothesis that the phrase was originally a notification by the deacon to the people that the consecration was completed.
4490 No evidence has been found to support this hypothesis, nor has any explanation been offered of why, if that was so, the words were later inserted in the midst of the words of Text and rubrics of the consecration of the wine, not at the end.
4494 Many people think that he is responsible for hiding the scandals that showed up from 2005 to 2006.
4496 MÅ¯stek A -LRB- completed in 1978 -RRB- has two exits through escalator tunnels -LRB- one on both ends of the middle aisle -RRB- with one vestibule below lower -LRB- NW -RRB- end of the Wenceslas Square -LRB- the preserved medieval bridge can be seen here -RRB- and the other below the central part of the square.

4529 From all offers submitted, AEMO 's systems determine the generators required to produce electricity based on the principle of meeting prevailing demand in the most cost-efficient way -LRB- See also Economic dispatch -RRB-.
4533 Initially, it might seem that since we use base 10 for nearly all calculations, this base would be more `` natural '' than base ` e', but there are several senses in which log ` e' is more `` natural ''.
4536 As a related example, consider the problem of differentiating a logarithmic function : : \ frac -LCB- d -RCB- -LCB- dx -RCB- \ log_b -LRB- x -RRB- = \ frac -LCB- \ log_b e -RCB- -LCB- x -RCB-.
4538 Another sense in which the base - ` e' logarithm is the most natural is that it can be defined quite easily in terms of a simple integral or Taylor series and this is not true of other logarithms.
4541 Accuracy is the most discussed topic on forums.

4544 It is rumored that the car manufacturers were very strict in how their vehicles were to be portrayed in this game, especially considering the `` illegal street racing '' reputation of the tuner culture.
4548 Many musicians who create what is considered `` neo-soul '' prefer to disassociate themselves from the tag, due to the term 's buzzword-like usage.
4549 These artists argue that many record labels, hoping to cash in on the success of the `` neo-soul '' style, simply had A&R departments take R&B singers, give them a bohemian look, and have them state Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, or Marvin Gaye as their favorite artists.
4550 Instead of using the `` neo-soul '' tag, many artists simply refer to themselves as soul musicians.

4571 Unfortunately for Western audiences, the vast quantity of bonus material to be found in the ` Renewal' boxed set has not been translated into English, and was omitted from the Platinum Edition, to say nothing of the Renewal box itself.
4572 Also, the ` Platinum Edition' does not include ` Director 's Cut' episodes 25' / 26' and has significantly degraded video and sound quality when compared directly with the ` Renewal' set.
4574 It was released in 1998 and is considered to be the final form of the ` Evangelion' movies.
4576 Currently released and opened from its earlier beta phases, the NC Mall has a variety of wearable grouped into categories : Clothing/Shoes, Accessories, Backgrounds, Trinkets, Superpacks, and Other Items.

4579 Some users object to this new addition, because The Neopets Team promised that the site would remain free, but after Viacom purchesed the site, it has been increasingly moving away from that original premise.
4580 Some people are complaining that TNT is giving wealthier people a unfair advantage, as many of the new releases on Neopets are related to the Nc Mall in some way.
4581 With the addition of the new pet rating system, in which other users can rate Neopets, some users are protesting the Nc Mall.

''.
4618 Additionally, claims allege Labour used over $ 400,000 of taxpayers' money to produce a number of pamphlets and `` pledge cards '' promoting Labour.
4619 The police decided not to lay a prosecution, preferring instead to warn Labour that similar future offences would risk prosecution, because it seemed clear that a number of other parties had also used similar tactics and it would have appeared unfair to single Labour out.

4624 However, some critics suggest they are undermined by lower quality media, which do not satisfactorily provide information and critical analysis.
4627 The only way in which the media can be expected to be able to set the agenda is if it is in an area in which very few Americans have direct experience of the issues.
4629 When American military personnel are involved, the media needs to report because the personnel are related to the American public.
4630 The media is also likely to have an interest in reporting issues with major direct effects on American workers, such as major trade agreements with Mexico.
4631 In other cases, it is difficult to see how the media can be prevented from setting the foreign policy agenda.

4665 Although fans of Martin could benefit, fans of Ms. Aguilera were peeved as they felt that they should be able to obtain the song without buying Mr. Martin 's album -LRB- which went against the sneaky plans of Sony to help increase album sales of ` Sound Loaded' by thinking that Aguilera fans would have no choice, but to buy the album. -RRB-.
4666 However, the fans of Aguilera and casual listeners -LRB- who enjoyed the song, but were not really fans of either artist -RRB- were not pleased with this option, and Sony was flooded with complaints over the limited options of release of this single.
4667 To quickly control damage, the free promotional CD Singles of `` Nobody Wants to Be Lonely '' were sent to stores and ordered to be packaged with rubber bands to the original album to entice people to buy the album -LRB- with Sony thinking that people would be more encouraged to buy the album if they could see the free promotional CD Single instead of having to send in proof of purchase to get it -RRB-.

4713 In Jamaica, slaves from different areas of Africa were brought into contact, creating some conflicts between those who practiced varying African religions.
4714 Those of West African Ashanti descent, who called their priests `` Myal men '' -LRB- also spelled Mial men -RRB-, used the Ashanti term `` Obi '' or `` Obeah '' -- meaning `` sorcery '' -- to describe the practices of slaves of Central African descent.
4716 Obeah also came to mean any physical object, such as a talisman or charm, that was used for evil magical purposes.
4717 However, despite its fearsome reputation, Obeah, like any other form of folk religion and folk magic, contains many traditions for healing, helping, and bringing about luck in love and money.
4722 By some accounts, she herself arranged for Odette to take her place in the mentally ill king 's bed ; by others, Odette was put in the position of royal mistress by higher forces as a means to `` ensure the influence of the Burgundian king ''.

4847 Many have lumped current neoconservative foreign policy with leftist foreign policy.
4849 Most paleoconservaties believe supporting Israel is not in the United States' interests and that it is hypocritical for neoconservatives to support massive immigration at home while staunchly supporting an ethnocentric state that automatically admits ethnic Jews but not non-Jewish Palestinians, and does n't currently allow civil marriages involving Jews and non-Jews -LRB- although it recognises them if performed outside the country -RRB-.

5139 In the Republic of Ireland, there was some sympathy for the IRA movement in the early 1970s.
5140 However, the movement 's appeal was hurt badly by more notorious bombings widely perceived as atrocities, such as the killing of civilians attending a Remembrance Day ceremony at the cenotaph in Enniskillen in 1987 and the death of two children when a bomb exploded in Warrington, which led to tens of thousands of people demonstrating on O'Connell Street in Dublin to call for an end to the IRA 's campaign.

5152 But Protestants have also applied the word ` Apocrypha' to texts found in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox scriptures which were not found in Hebrew manuscripts.
5154 Accordingly, there arose in some Protestant Biblical scholarship an extended use of the term ` pseudepigrapha' for works that appeared as though they ought to be part of the Bibical canon, because of the authorship ascribed to them, but which stood outside both the Biblical canons recognized by Protestants and Catholics.
5155 These works were also outside the particular set of books that Roman Catholics called ` deuterocanonical' and to which Protestants had generally applied the term Apocryphal.
5156 Accordingly, the term ` pseudepigraphical', as now used often among both Protestants and Roman Catholics -LRB- allegedly for the clarity it brings to discussion -RRB-, may make it difficult to discuss questions of pseudepigraphical authorship of canonical books dispassionately with an unsophisticated audience.
5157 To confuse the matter even more, Orthodox Christians accept books as canonical, that Roman Catholics and most Protestant denominations consider pseudepigraphical or at best of much less authority.
5158 There exist also churches that reject some of the books that Roman Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants accept.

5381 Most of the $ 200,000,000 figure cited by Abbott paid for clinical trials-despite NIH offering to pay for them-because Abbott was concerned about `` public interest '' responses to the high prices they projected Norvir would command..

5413 When Chapman re-issued the, by now best seller ` The Pickwick Papers' in book form, he now included a disclaimer statement from Dickens stating ;' `` Mr. Seymour never originated or suggested an incident, a phrase, or a word to be found in this book.

6271 Different types of smokeless tobacco carry different risk profiles.
6273 One thing is abundantly clear : a large body of science supports the conclusion that smokeless tobacco products of the sort used in Sweden -LRB- snus -RRB- are significantly safer than cigarettes.
6274 Sweden has the lowest level of tobacco related illness in Europe, is the only country which has reduced its smoking below the WHO 's target level, and is the only EU country in which snus -LRB- a Swedish smokeless tobacco cured in such a way as to minimize the most important classes of carcinogens -RRB- is legal.
6275 It should be noted, also, that all data in Sweden indicates that the direction of `` movement '' of tobacco users between products is toward snus, and away from smoking, thus refuting claims that cigarette companies favor introducing snus -LRB- or other popular Western smokeless products - all of which have been documented to be safer than cigarettes -RRB- with an eye towards getting people habituated to cigarettes at a later time.
6276 On the contrary, it 's very clear that cigarette companies wish to introduce smokeless products in Europe because they realize that a safer product will appeal to customers and to society in general, thus making it possible to turn a profit even as cigarette crackdowns gain momentum.
6277 Luckily, the interests of the tobacco companies and of society in general intersect in this case - the availability of snus products, as has been proven in Sweden, leads to a reduction in cigarette smoking and a reduction in tobacco related illness.

6309 When he was caught, Mr Reid admitted that the money was subject to a constructive trust, but argued that he should only be liable to repay the amount of the bribes, and then any profit attributable to the increase in value of the land in New Zealand was not connected with his wrongdoing.
6310 However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the government of Hong Kong 's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.
