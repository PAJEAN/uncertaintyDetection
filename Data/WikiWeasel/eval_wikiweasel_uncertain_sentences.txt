The original minting of the coin from 1928 until 1942 contained 75 % silver ; this Irish coin had a higher content than the equivalent British coin.

To the southeast of the crater rim, emplacement of hummocky ejecta appears to have been impeded by the topography of preexisting ridges, thus suggesting a very low ground-hugging mode of deposition for this material.

It has also been suggested that there are two schools of thought among the Republic 's Jedi.
On the other hand, Yoda 's school, which is the dominant school in the Jedi Council, would state that the Force is purely a mystical interconnection between all things -LRB- `` Here, between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere ! Yes, even between this land and that ship ! '' he teaches Luke in ` Episode V' -RRB- and that midi-chlorians are at most a consequence of the ability with the Force, hence the reliance of the Council on true tests of Anakin 's ability with the Force, even though Qui-Gon has certified the large number of midi-chlorians in his blood.
Yoda 's school does have some support for Midi-chlorians being merely the biological way of describing the mystical force because despite the high midi-chlorian count Anakin turned to the dark side failing in the test of mind.
It is already known that Qui-Gon is a pariah among the Jedi, so it would n't be surprising if he had a slightly different view of the Force than the dominant theory.
However, if this were the case, it could be expected that Qui-Gon 's apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, would subscribe to his master 's school of thought.
This could be a consequence of his exposure to Yoda 's teachings.
Midi-chlorians were extremely controversial among fans when their existence was first revealed in ` Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace'.
They were never mentioned in the original trilogy, and many fans believed they diluted the spiritual aspect of ` Star Wars' by making the connection to the Force biological rather than mystical.
However, it may have already been established in the original trilogy that the Force was genetic -LRB- through heredity -RRB- and passed down through families.
Some argue that this was intentionally jarring ; a way to imply that the Jedi Order of the time had become so bureaucratic that even one 's potential in the ways of the Force was measured by a single statistic.
