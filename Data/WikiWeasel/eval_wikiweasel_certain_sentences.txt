The conditioned ADR beam of photons penetrates the rock and as it encounters the component materials it stimulates the atoms to release energy according to their compositions.
The conditioned pulse of photons passes through the structure of the atom and emerges to encounter more atoms further along its path.
Electrons from each individual atom release energy in all directions, and by timing the first arrival of this burst of low energy from a time-zero position beside the transmitting source, enables the distance to the responding atoms encountered to be determined.
The nature of the return signal, its frequency and energy levels and phase changes -LRB- if any -RRB- are determined by the minerals encountered.

In quantum mechanics, due to the Heisenberg 's uncertainty principle, an electron can never be at rest ; it must always have a non-zero kinetic energy, a result not found in classical mechanics.
For example, if we consider something very large relative to an electron, like a baseball, the uncertainty principle predicts that it can not have zero kinetic energy, but the uncertainty in kinetic energy is so small that the baseball can appear to be at rest, and hence appears to obey classical mechanics.
In general, if large energies and large objects -LRB- relative to the size and energy levels of an electron -RRB- are considered in quantum mechanics, the result will appear to obey classical mechanics.

The ` climate of Northern Ireland' is an oceanic climate, or temperate maritime climate.
It is classified as ` Cfb' on the Köppen climate classification system.
Northern Ireland has a latitude between 54 ° N and 56 ° N and winters are much milder and wetter than many other cities on this latitude, such as Moscow, Omsk or Novosibirsk.
However, summers are generally cooler and wetter than other cities along a similar latitude.
These climatic differences are because of the prevailing westerly winds from the Gulf Stream, a warm Atlantic ocean current.
The influence of the Gulf Stream also ensures the coastline of Northern Ireland remains ice-free throughout the winter-unlike for example the Sea of Okhotsk and the Labrador Sea which are at a similar latitude.
The climate in Northern Ireland does not experience extreme weather, with tornadoes and similar weather features being rare.

Color analysis is the process of determining the colors that best suit an individual 's natural coloring.
`` Winters '' and `` Summers '' have cool coloring.
`` Springs '' and `` Autumns '' have warm coloring.
Another system of color analysis relies on analysing whether the person 's coloring has high or low contrast ; for instance, dark hair and pale skin create high contrast.
Under this system, individuals are classified as `` light-bright, '' `` muted, '' `` gentle '' and `` contrast. ''.
The correlated color temperature can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the chromaticity co-ordinates in the CIE 1960 color space, then finding the closest point on the Planckian locus.

This just means that for a given sections s of E, the value of P -LRB- s -RRB- at a point x \ in M is fully determined by the ` k' - th order infinitesimal behavior of s in x..
In particular this implies that P -LRB- s -RRB- -LRB- x -RRB- is determined by the germ of s in x, which is expressed by saying that differential operators are local.
A foundational result is the Peetre theorem showing that the converse is also true : any local operator is differential.

Because the 0.9 mm thickness of the DualDisc CD layer does not conform to Red Book CD Specifications, which call for a layer no less than 1.1 mm thick, some CD players may not be able to play the CD side of a DualDisc due to a phenomenon called spherical aberration.
As a result, the laser reading the CD side might get a `` blurry '' picture of the data on the disc - the equivalent of a human reading a book with glasses of the wrong strength.
Engineers have tried to get around this by making the pits in the CD layer larger than on a conventional CD.
This makes the CD side easier for the laser to read - equivalent to the book using bigger print to make it easier to see, even if the person 's glasses are of the wrong strength.

The results of the vote were later bitterly contested by a group which believed the victims should have received more.
As light travels through a medium other than vacuum, interaction with this medium causes its amplitude and phase to change in a way which depends on properties of the medium.
Changes in amplitude give rise to familiar absorption of light which gives rise to colours when it is wavelength dependent.
The human eye measures only the energy of light arriving on the retina, so changes in phase are not easily observed, yet often these changes in phase carry a large amount of information.

Stirner argued that self-welfare should be the guiding principle to follow rather than law.
Stirner relates that you can get further with a handful of might than you can with a bagful of right.
Anyone who breaks the law is violating what is sacred.
Therefore there are no criminals except against something sacred.
If you do away with the sacrosanctity of the law then crime will disappear, because in reality a crime is nothing more than an act desecrating that which was hallowed by the state.
There are, according to Stirner, no rights, because might makes right and an individual is entitled to everything he has the power to possess and hold.
A person only becomes completely free when what he holds, he holds because of his might.
Then he is a self-owner and not a mere freeman.
Stirner does not believe that a person is good or bad, nor does he believe in what is true, good, right, and so on.

This description of Gnosticism has little, if any, resemblance to Gnosticism expressed in the Nag Hammadi writings.
Voegelin 's definition of Eschaton would be more toward the idea that Gnostics are really rejecting `` Christianity 's '' eschaton of Heaven and Hell and replacing it with a human form of salvation through revelation by mystical ritual or practice.
understanding would be completely compatible with the Gnostic concept that the truth lies inside man and not in the Judeo-Christian God or demiurge.
Though that eschaton would be God induced and not by the innovations of mankind.
Also Voegelin attempted to clarify that gnostics had a constructive intention in their motive rather then the more destructive motive that could be derived from believing that the material world was evil and that it should be destroyed rather then repaired or improved.
Also the `` improvement '' through knowledge might be indirect like individualist -LRB- psychological -RRB- rather then say an improvement directly to the material world.
As in knowledge for knowledge 's sake.

He posits that regular Internet usage may have the effect of diminishing the capacity for concentration and contemplation.
He cites Maryanne Wolf, an expert on reading, for her expertise on the role of media and technology in learning written languages.
Carr raises the point that unlike speech, which is an innate ability hardwired into the human brain, the ability to read has to be taught in order for the brain to rearrange its original parts for the task of interpreting symbols into words.
He acknowledges that his argument does not yet have the backing of long-term neurological and psychological studies.
Carr further draws on Wolf 's work, particularly her 2007 book ` Proust and the Squid', to relate his argument to the way in which neural circuits in the reading brain are specifically shaped by the demands particular to each written language, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Alphabet-based scripts.
Therefore, Carr purports that the neural circuitry shaped by regular Internet usage can also be expected to be different from that shaped by the reading of books and other page-based written material.

Hutchison also says that he invented a form of batteries, which he calls `` Crystal Batteries '' or `` Hiroshima cells ''.
He claims they obtain energy from the quantum vacuum using the Casimir effect.
The basic formula for the batteries described by John includes : Rochelle salts, gallium, iron pyrite, and germanium.
As the mixture cools inside the vessel of choice, an electrode is placed in the center.
As the mixture solidifies, a high voltage current induced aligns the platelets of the different chemicals.
A magnet is also used to continuously induce a flow of electrons which accumulate to the post.
The germanium acts as a valve, or diode allowing electrons to travel in only one direction, thus creating a sustaining flow that never stops.
The largest battery of this type ever created had a potential of about one million volts.
Due to inconsistencies in the mixture, it became unstable and exploded covering the lab with powder.
This device used in conjunction with a spectrum analyzer or scope has been used in the location of oil and mineral deposits from the air coupled with an old laptop.

Like other fluorocarbon based liquids, perfluorohexane solubilizes gases including oxygen from the air to a higher concentration than is found in other liquids.
This effect is due to the nature of the fluorine atom causing low intramolecular forces between perfluorohexane molecules, which allows `` space '' for gas molecules to partition into the liquid.
Animals can be submerged in a bath of perfluorohexane without drowning, as there is sufficient oxygen available in the solvent to allow respiration to continue.
This has led to the experimental use of perfluorohexane in treating burns victims, as their lungs can be filled with either perfluorohexane vapor or in extreme cases liquid perfluorohexane, allowing breathing to continue without the problems normally seen with pulmonary edema that sometimes occur when the inside of the lungs have been burnt e.g. by inhalation of hot smoke.

` Reincarnation research' is a field of inquiry that records and analyzes the discourse of people who claim to have had past lives.
The field is roughly divided into two components : researchers and therapists.
The researchers study the putative past life memories of children, as well as birthmarks that they interpret as the result of past life experiences, publishing their results in scientific journals.
Therapists, usually using hypnosis, attempt to help clients recall these putative past life memories.
Typically, the child will begin talking about these memories at around three years of age, and will lose these memories at around age seven.
If scientists can interview these children ` before' contact is made with persons familiar with the supposed previous family, then an objective comparison can be made between the statements made by the child and the actual features of the previous life.

In 1985, Amos formed a music group, Y Kant Tori Read.
Tori came up with the name as a reference to her days back at the Peabody conservatory, where she was able to play songs on her piano simply after hearing them once, but was never able to get the hang of reading and playing from sheet music.
Besides Amos, the group was composed of the aforementioned Caton, drummer Matt Sorum, bass player Brad Cobb and keyboardist Jim Tauber -LRB- for a short time -RRB-.
A year later, Atlantic Records gave Amos a six-record contract.
After the flop, Amos began working with other artists -LRB- including Stan Ridgway of Wall of Voodoo, Sandra Bernhard, and Al Stewart -RRB- as a backup vocalist.

Under Hong Kong law, the proceeds of those bribes were held on constructive trusts for the government of Hong Kong.
Mr Reid then investing the proceeds of the bribes in land in New Zealand, and the land increased substantially in value.
When he was caught, Mr Reid admitted that the money was subject to a constructive trust, but argued that he should only be liable to repay the amount of the bribes, and then any profit attributable to the increase in value of the land in New Zealand was not connected with his wrongdoing.
However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the government of Hong Kong 's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.
She retired from acting soon after and sued MGM, which was settled out of court.

British analysts in World War I noticed that the call sign of German Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commanding the hostile fleet, had been transferred to a land-based station.
Admiral Beattie, ignorant of Scheer 's practice of changing callsigns upon leaving harbor, dismissed its importance and disregarded Room 40 analysts' attempts to make the point.
The German fleet sortied, and the British were late in meeting them at the Battle of Jutland.
If traffic analysis been taken more seriously, the British might have done better than a ` draw'.
In early World War II, the aircraft carrier HMS ` Glorious' was evacuating pilots and planes from Norway.
Traffic analysis produced indications German battlecruiser ` Scharnhorst' and German battlecruiser ` Gneisenau' were moving into the North Sea, but the Admiralty dismissed the report as unproven.
The captain of ` Glorious' did not keep sufficient lookout, and was subsequently surprised and sunk.
Harry Hinsley, the young Bletchley Park liaison to the Admiralty, later said his reports from the traffic analysts were taken much more seriously thereafter.
During the planning and rehearsal for the attack on Pearl Harbor, very little traffic passed by radio, subject to interception.
The ships, units, and commands involved were all in Japan and in touch by phone, courier, signal lamp, or even flag.

Antimotility agents -LRB- loperamide, diphenoxylate, and paregoric -RRB- primarily reduce diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut, and, thus, allows more time for absorption.
However, these agents should never be used by persons with fever or bloody diarrhea, because they can increase the severity of disease by delaying clearance of causative organisms.
Adverse complications -LRB- toxic megacolon, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation -RRB- have been reported as a result of using these medications to treat diarrhea.

As a Congressman, he voted against renewal of the Voting Rights Act, voted against the continuation of the Civil Rights Act and opposed the Martin Luther King Holiday.
Lott also maintained for many years an affiliation with the Council of Conservative Citizens, which is described as a hate group by the Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Triangulation can also refer to the accurate surveying of systems of very large triangles, called ` triangulation networks'.
This followed from the work of Willebrord Snell in 1615-17, who showed how a point could be located from the angles subtended from ` three' known points, but measured at the new unknown point rather than the previously fixed points, a problem called resectioning.
Surveying error is minimised if a mesh of triangles at the largest appropriate scale is established first, that points inside the triangles can all then be accurately located with reference to.
Such triangulation methods dominated accurate large-scale land surveying until the rise of Global navigation satellite systems in the 1980s.

Theoretically, the winner scores one game point to every.
Hoewever, before playing to a trick, either player may offer to increase the score for a win by asking : `` Two more ? ''.
The first such increase raises the value from 1 point to 2, and subsequently increases add 2 more each, raising the game value from 2 to 4, than 6, and so on.
If the other says : `` Yes '', play continues, if not he throws his hand in, play ceases and the challenger scores whatever it was worth before he offered to raise.

The weldability of steels is inversely proportional to a property known as the hardenability of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment.
In order to be able to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel.
The effect on weldability of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example.
As the equivalent carbon content rises, the weldability of the alloy decreases.
The disadvantage to using plain carbon and low-alloy steels is their lower strength-there is a trade-off between material strength and weldability.
