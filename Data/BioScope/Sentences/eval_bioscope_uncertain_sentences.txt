Selectively targeting Tregs and Th17 cells are likely to be important strategies in the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases in humans.
It is also clear that the notion of a single type of Th17 cell may not be correct, as there seems to be further complexity in terms of the cytokines produced by these cells.
Until a few years ago we thought we knew which subset of helper T cells was responsible for host defense or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases and we thought that answer fit well with the standard Th1/Th2 cells paradigm -LRB- 11 -RRB-.
Traditionally, autoimmune diseases had been assumed to be associated with dysregulated Th1 responses -LRB- 13 -RRB-.
Because the treatment with anti-IL-12p40 antibody was effective in Crohn 's disease -LRB- CD -RRB- and psoriasis -LRB- 14, 15 -RRB-, it was further assumed that IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production and Th1 response were involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.
In human disease, the mRNA levels of both IL-23p19 and IL-12p40 were shown to be increased in skin lesions of psoriatic patients -LRB- 24 -RRB-, suggesting that elevated IL-23 contributed to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
It was very clear that development of IL-17-producing T cells was not dependent on the cytokines and the transcription factors required for Th1 or Th2 differentiation and then it was proposed that IL-17-producing CD4 + T cells represented a new subset of helper T cells -LRB- Th17 cells -RRB-, which were crucial in mediating inflammatory responses -LRB- 30-32 -RRB-.
While there was evidence that IL-23 stimulated CD4 + T cells to express various genes, including IL-17, and that IL-23-stimulated T cells were important in the pathogenesis of EAE -LRB- 30 -RRB-, it was less clear whether IL-23 was the factor that drove naive CD4 + T cells to become IL-17 producers.
The role of Stat3 in Th17 differentiation seems to be remarkably direct -- i.e. Stat3 binds to the Il17 and Il21 loci, as detected by using chromatin immunoprecipitation -LRB- ChiP -RRB- assays -LRB- 38, 41 -RRB-.
Furthermore, RORγt-deficient mice are less susceptible to EAE, suggesting that RORγt is a key regulator of Th17 differentiation -LRB- 8 -RRB-.
However, the precise molecular mechanisms of Stat3-mediated expression of RORγt are still unclear.
Even so, RORγt could be a good candidate to target in treating inflammatory diseases -LRB- discussed in further detail below -RRB-.
RORα seems to synergize with RORγt to promote development of Th17 lineage -LRB- 47 -RRB-.
Because of their potential for inducing immune-mediated damage to the host, it is perhaps not surprising that multiple mechanisms exist to inhibit the production of Th17 cells -LRB- Fig. 1b -RRB-.
However, how IFN-γ and IL-4 inhibit IL-17 production is not yet known.
These reports suggest a cross-regulatory relationship among Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation.
However, it still remains to be determined how Th1-related and Th2-related transcription factors negatively regulate IL-17 production.
The mechanism by which Tregs preserve peripheral tolerance is still not entirely clear ; however, they preferentially express cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 -LRB- CTLA-4 -RRB-, and immunosuppressive cytokines including TGFß-1 and IL-10 -LRB- 55-57 -RRB-.
This putative relationship also led to investigation of the importance of IL-2 in Th17 differentiation -LRB- 44 -RRB-.
Furthermore, blockade of IL-2 or deletion of Stat5 promoted Th17 differentiation, suggesting that IL-2 inhibited Th17 lineage by affecting the RORγt-Foxp3 balance -LRB- 44 -RRB-.
Therefore, helper T cells seem to have a unique way of achieving a balance between Tregs and Th17 cells during ongoing immune responses.
Interestingly, Foxp3 may inhibit RORγt activity on its target genes, at least in par, t through direct interaction with RORγt -LRB- 63 -RRB-.
Paradoxically, IL-6 and TGFß-1 seem to drive initial Th17 lineage commitment but also restrain the pathogenic potential of Th17 cells by producing IL-10 also -LRB- 34 -RRB-.
As such, their relevance may vary among different autoimmune diseases.
TGFß-1 seems to have dual effects on human Th17 differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.
Of these latter cytokines, IL-23 seems to be the most effective -LRB- 10, 66, 72, 73 -RRB-.
Because CCR6 + CD4 + T cells, but not CCR6-CD4 + T cells, secrete IL-17 and expression of IL-23R, CCR6, and RORγt is up-regulated during Th17 differentiation -LRB- 72 -RRB-, these factors seem to be essential for development of human Th17 lineage.
Importantly, it has been shown that mutations presumed to underlie hyper-IgE syndrome -LRB- HIES, `` Job 's syndrome '' -RRB- are identified in the STAT3 gene -LRB- 46 -RRB-.
Purified naive CD4 + T cells from HIES individuals can not differentiate into Th17 cells in vitro and have lower expression of RORγt -LRB- 46 -RRB-, suggesting that Stat3 signaling is also a crucial factor for the generation of human Th17 cells.
Although Th17 cells are important and essential subsets participating in host defense against extracellular antigens, evidence implicating Th17 cells as a causal factor of autoimmune diseases is also mounting -LRB- 25 -RRB-.
These results argue strongly for a role of the IL-23 / IL-17 axis in human autoimmune diseases.
It is of particular interest to evaluate the contribution of Th17 cells to the pathogenesis of RA, because targeting pathogenetic Th17 might be a reasonable strategy for treating RA.
Because the expression of IL-17 and IL-23p19 was observed in the synovial fluid and serum of RA patients, these factors were presumed to be pathogenic -LRB- 85 -RRB-.
Taken together, these multiple factors induced by IL-17 seem to promote bone resorption, extracellular matrix degradation, synovium proliferation, angiogenesis, and recruitment and activation of immune cells for bone erosion and articular destruction in RA joints.
This being said, there is little evidence of T cell proliferation in RA and we still do not know for certain the cellular source of IL-17 in RA synovium -LRB- 88 -RRB-.
For these reasons, IL-17 seems to be a rational target in the treatment of RA, and Phase I/II clinical trials of anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibody -LRB- AIN457 -RRB- have commenced -LRB- http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ -RRB-.
Therefore, anti-IL-17 therapy may become an alternative for treating patients unresponsive to conventional anti-TNF therapy.
It still remains to be seen whether blocking IL-17 will affect other proinflammatory cytokines for example IL-6, IL-1, and IL-22 in RA patients.
To what extent their efficacy relates to inhibition of IL-17 will be important to ascertain.
Although IL-1 has been reported to contribute to Th17 differentiation in mouse and man, it remains to be determined whether therapeutic targeting of IL-1 will substantially affect IL-17 in RA.
Whether selectively targeting IL-23p19 will be more efficacious or have a better safety profile remains to be determined.
In principle, targeting IL-21 might also be efficacious in treating RA in which IL-17 is involved in immune-mediated damage.
It will be important to know whether the efficacy of this drug is related to inhibition of IL-17.
It now seems that Th17 cells are one of the more important villains in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.
There is no doubt that IL-17 and the other proinflammatory cytokines are likely to be relevant therapeutic targets in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases.
Protein levels of nuclear AID are tightly controlled, as unregulated expression can lead to alterations in the immune response.
We therefore suggest that estrogen-induced autoimmunity and oncogenesis may be derived through AID-dependent DNA instability.
Furthermore, SHM, by way of AID, may contribute to lymphomagenesis by mutating -LRB- proto - -RRB- oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, or by promoting chromosomal translocations -LRB- 12 -- 14 -RRB-.
Outside the immune system, there are indications that systemic hyperexpression of AID can induce non -- B cell cancers from lung -LRB- 20 -RRB-, lymphatic -LRB- 20 -RRB-, and liver -LRB- 21 -RRB- tissues.
AID has also been implicated as a developmental epigenetic reprogramming factor, and its expression levels in oocytes is almost equivalent to that in lymph nodes -LRB- 22 -RRB-, suggesting that AID could be regulated by pathways other than B cell activation pathways -LRB- e.g., E-box proteins -LSB- 23 -RSB-, NF-κB -LSB- 24 -RSB-, and Pax5 -LSB- 25 -RSB- -RRB-, with hormones being plausible candidates.
Several clinical and epidemiological studies have indicated that females can have stronger and more rapid immune responses upon antigen encounter -LRB- 26, 27 -RRB-.
Estrogen and its biological and synthetic derivatives are thought to be oncogenic for breast and ovarian tissue -LRB- 32, 33 -RRB-, most often being associated with their growth-promoting and differentiating capacity.
Our data indicate that the mutagenic DNA deaminases are potentially an important target for hormonal regulation.
This was done to avoid a possible maximal induction of LPS/IL -4 caused by longer treatment.
This antithetical effect of estrogen and progesterone indicated that AID gene regulation is embedded within a systemic sex hormone pathway.
Because we could determine that the expression of gene regulated in breast cancer 1 -LRB- a known estrogen response gene -RRB- -LRB- 36 -RRB- had a similar stimulation profile in B cells -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-, it seemed likely that the AID gene could also be activated in uninduced B cells with estrogen.
In most systems, the synthetic hormone Tam acts as an antagonist to estrogen stimulation, presumably by binding to the estrogen receptor -LRB- ER -RRB- and altering its DNA binding capacity -LRB- 37 -RRB-.
Interestingly, at very low concentrations, Tam can have a stimulatory effect on AID mRNA -LRB- Fig. S1 A, available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080521/DC1 -RRB-, which may reflect Tam 's agonistic activity -LRB- see Discussion -RRB-.
Although we were able to observe an increase in AID mRNA at 2 h -LRB- Fig. 1 -RRB-, we needed to determine if this regulation was direct or indirect.
This suggested that the effect of estrogen was directly mediated on AID 's mRNA synthesis.
Because qRT-PCR of cDNA is a readout of steady-state mRNA, we also tested if the increase by estrogen was caused by transcription or mRNA metabolism.
Treatment of cells with transcription inhibitors -LRB- actinomycin D -LSB- ACT -RSB- and α-amanitin -LSB- AMA -RSB- -RRB- abrogated the effect of estrogen, indicating that this alteration in AID 's mRNA was not caused by message stability -LRB- Fig. S1 B -RRB-.
The intron between exon 3 and 4 -LRB- 7,538 -- 7,689 bp -RRB- showed a marginal increase in response to estrogen over that of the mature RNA, indicating a potential region for estrogen-induced splicing of AID RNA.
Because the relative change did not significantly alter the overall effect, we did not pursue this analysis further, although recent data suggests that alternative splicing may influence AID expression -LRB- 39 -RRB-.
The rapid effect of the hormones on AID message via transcription suggested that the AID gene is a direct target for hormonal regulation.
The potential response regions were placed into a luciferase reporter construct and transfected into human SiHa cells, followed by treatment with the indicated hormone -LRB- or cotransfected with expression plasmids -RRB-, and then analyzed for luciferase activity.
As we were primarily interested in the effect of hormones on expression, we used relative change as a readout rather than absolute values, which provided a more direct evaluation of the hormone treatment but potentially obscured the individual effect of the various DNA elements.
When compared with DMSO treatment, estrogen responsiveness was most significant with Fragment C, indicating that this contained the predominant estrogen-responsive DNA element.
As indicated by the qRT-PCR analysis in Fig. 1 A, estrogen and the LPS/IL -4 -- induced NF-κB stress-response pathway could act synergistically on AID mRNA production.
This indicated that in the AID promoter, the NF-κB site and its proximal ERE could act independently as well as synergistically.
The transient transfection assay indicated that a predicted ERE was subject to estrogen regulation.
Cotreatment with estrogen and TNF-α had the same effect as estrogen alone -LRB- Fig. 3 B, lane 5 -RRB-, indicating that the two pathways act through different nuclear proteins.
The anti-ERα antibody did induce the appearance of a high molecular weight complex -LRB- Fig. 3 C, triangle in lanes 4 and 5 -RRB-, which could be caused by either the supershift of a dimerized ERα or heterodimer ERα / ERß ; however, this needs to be analyzed further.
Because estrogen and TNF-α co-stimulation did not alter ER binding to the ERE, we wanted to determine if the reciprocal of NF-κB binding to the NF-κB site, after the combined treatment, was also unaffected.
This indicated that the respective treatments did not alter the general DNA-binding properties of ER or NF-κB proteins.
Although the in vitro binding of the ER to the AID promoter indicated a direct binding, we also wanted to probe this interaction in vivo.
For us to determine if the effect of estrogen on AID would also extend to the protein level, we developed a quantitative approach for measuring AID protein.
In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 -LRB- Fig. 4 C -RRB-, estrogen increased AID-FM production above that of the MG-132 alone, indicating that estrogen was not acting on the proteasome to increase AID-FM activity.
On the molecular level, CSR requires AID, yet regulation can be achieved on multiple levels, some of which may be hormonally influenced.
To ensure we could correlate AID activity precisely, and to avoid possible proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of estrogen on stimulated B cells, we monitored the early molecular events of class switching.
Presumably through the increased production of AID, estrogen was able to enhance switch circle formation for all subclasses tested.
In each experiment, 2 spleens per sample were treated with or without 50 nM estrogen in the presence of LPS for 72 h..
Because AID + / - mice show a haploinsufficiency effect -LRB- 43, 44 -RRB-, we used F1 spleens from an AID - / - and BALB/c cross for analysis, hypothesizing that the estrogen effect would be more pronounced.
The effect of aberrant AID targeting can lead to somatic mutations or even translocations of protooncogenes or tumor suppressors, and subsequently to oncogenesis -LRB- 16 -RRB-.
To determine if the activity of hormones via AID can also lead to an alteration in non-Ig loci, we chose to look at the proapoptotic tumor suppressor CD95/Fas.
As with the physiological B cell maturation events of SHM and CSR, estrogen was able to increase the potentially pathogenic mutation frequency in CD95/Fas -LRB- Fig. 5 C and Fig. S7 B -RRB-.
This highlights the importance of regulating AID protein amounts within a cell, and the potential pathogenic consequences of unregulated AID expression.
In the past, we demonstrated that AID mRNA expression is not limited to activated B cells, but can also be detected in oocytes -LRB- 22 -RRB-.
We therefore set out to determine if the increase in AID mRNA production by estrogen was also detectable in dissected tissues and various tumor cell lines.
Because isolated oocytes produce AID mRNA -LRB- 22 -RRB-, we suggest that the increase was predominantly caused by oocytes or other ovarian-derived tissue, rather than infiltrating lymphocytes.
Gross tissue dissection can provide a good indication of possible cell types that can induce AID mRNA upon estrogen treatment, but tissue complexity could also obscure potential targets.
We hypothesized that hormonal responsiveness may have been conserved among members of the APOBEC3 family.
Here, we propose another means by which estrogen can be a genotoxin, by directly inducing DNA deaminases such as AID.
Estrogen exerted its activity through the estrogen -- ER complex, directly binding to the AID promoter, whereas our preliminary data suggests that progesterone acts through an estrogen-independent pathway -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-.
The consequences of estrogen activation on AID mRNA could also be detected as an increase in AID protein and enhanced downstream physiological effects, such as SHM and CSR.
This could indicate that although AID production is necessary for SHM, other factors -LRB- e.g., lesion processing, AID targeting, etc -RRB- can play a significant role in overall SHM efficiency -LRB- 53 -RRB-.
Overexpression of AID in autoimmune-prone mice induced a more severe systemic lupus erythematosus -- like phenotype -LRB- 10 -RRB-, whereas breeding AID-deficient mice with autoimmune-prone MRL/lpr mice significantly reduced the onset and extent of disease -LRB- 11 -RRB-, indicating that alterations in AID can change the severity of B cell autoimmunity.
Correlating our data with the known effects of estrogen on autoimmunity -LRB- 28, 30, 50, 54 -RRB-, we propose that the effect of sex-hormones on autoimmunity could partially be through AID transcription and subsequent increase in genome instability.
In addition to the direct binding of the estrogen -- ER complex to the AID promoter, estrogen may also hyperstimulate AID production through the NF-κB pathway, as we were able to demonstrate that cotreatment of TNF-α and estrogen enhanced NF-κB binding to the AID promoter -LRB- Fig. 3 D -RRB-.
Whether this effect is caused by protein -- protein interaction or estrogen-induced chromatin modification has yet to be determined, but the synergistic or even cooperative interaction of two important autoimmune modulator pathways on AID expression may have substantially pathogenic effects.
There are several hypotheses on how unregulated AID can affect autoimmunity in addition to overstimulation of SHM and CSR, e.g., debilitating mutations in the signaling pathways, of tumor suppressors, or of proapoptotic genes, or alterations that activate oncogenes or antiapoptotic genes -LRB- for review see reference -LSB- 55 -RSB- -RRB-.
Therefore, our data on estrogen-induced mutations in CD95/Fas -LRB- Fig. 5 and Fig. S7 -RRB-, derived from increased AID production, may provide a novel molecular mechanism that is important for both pathologies.
Furthermore, because the estrogen derivative Tam -LRB- 61 -RRB- can inhibit estrogen 's oncogenesis in breast cancer, it is unlikely that estrogen -LRB- or its derivatives -RRB- form DNA adducts under those conditions.
Thus, our findings that low concentrations of Tam induced AID mRNA -LRB- Fig. S1 -RRB- also suggest that Tam acts as an agonist and indicates that the proposed usage of synthetic estrogen derivatives as a means to inhibit AID has to be carefully evaluated.
Future work on identifying a potential role of AID in mouse models of hormonally induced cancers may provide further evidence on how AID can act as an environmentally stimulated oncogene.
As our data indicate, AID 's response to estrogen seems to have been evolutionarily conserved among the APOBEC3 family members, different tissues, and cell lines -LRB- Fig. 6 and Fig. S8 -RRB- ; mouse Apobec3 and human APOBEC3B, -3 F, and -3 G -LRB- and - H to a lesser extent -RRB- mRNA were induced by estrogen treatment.
In the past, we have hypothesized that the predominant function of AID and its evolved DNA deaminase family members was to inactivate foreign DNA in the cell -LRB- 8, 34, 64, 65 -RRB-.
Data indicating that AID has retained some ability to inhibit retroviral elements have substantiated this hypothesis -LRB- 66 -RRB-.
Our work has highlighted that there is a novel pathway by which the nonmutagenic hormone estrogen can mediate genome instability via the activation of AID and other DNA deaminases, in turn possibly altering the predispositions, induction, or severity for cancer, autoimmunity, and viral infectivity.
0.25 pmol of complementary oligonucleotides containing either NF-κB or putative ER binding elements were annealed, labeled, and added to 7 µg of Ramos -LRB- treated or untreated -RRB- nuclear extract.
Our model represents a robust organotypic and cell-type-specific Drosophila cancer model in which malignant cells are created by mutations in signature genes and pathways thought to be driving forces in a homologous human cancer.
These and other genes within this network may represent important therapeutic targets in human glioma.
Mutations in genes within the EGFR-Ras and PI3K signaling pathways are common in malignant gliomas, although how these genes specifically control glial pathogenesis is unclear.
This represents a robust cell-type-specific Drosophila cancer model in which malignant cells are created by mutations in genetic pathways thought to be driving forces in a homologous human cancer.
Rate-limiting genes within this network may represent important therapeutic targets in human glioma.
Understanding the interplay of these mutations and the neurodevelopmental origins of these tumors could lead to new insights into the mechanisms of gliomagenesis.
Thus, misregulation of these genetic pathways may confer unrestricted proliferative capacities to a range of glial cell types, but how this occurs remains unclear.
While many of the same effectors are utilized by EGFR-Ras and PI3K in both glial development and cancer, constitutive activation of these pathways may deploy distinct outputs, not utilized in development, that allow particular cells to escape normal physiological cues that restrain proliferation and self-renewal.
The identity of such outputs remains unclear.
Finally, glial overgrowth in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX larvae was strongly suppressed by co-overexpression of dPTEN or more moderately by dominant negative dRas85D -LRB- dRas85DN17 -RRB- -LRB- Figure 1D and 1E -RRB-, indicating that Ras activity and excess phospho-inositols are essential for neoplasia.
dRas85DV12 may be more potent than dEGFRλ because dRas85DV12 can activate endogenous PI3K signaling -LSB- 16 -RSB-.
Unlike dEGFRλ, dEGFRWT and dEGFRElp have functional ligand-binding domains -LRB- Figure S1 -RRB-, and may cause additional defects by sequestering ligand otherwise required for normal development -LSB- 17 -RSB-.
Like neoplastic epithelial cells, dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia ectopically expressed an active form of the matrix metalloprotease dMMP1 -LRB- Figure S3 -RRB-, which can confer an invasive potential -LSB- 19 -RSB-, -LSB- 20 -RSB-, implying that abnormal dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia may be invasive within the brain.
Relative to controls, many dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia showed BrdU incorporation, which marks S-phase cells -LRB- Figure 2D and 2E -RRB-, indicating that neoplastic glia arise from overproliferation.
The gross neural morphogenesis defects observed in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX brains may be secondary to glial overproliferation since these defects were largely prevented by Dap or Rbf1 co-overexpression -LRB- Figure 2J -- M -RRB-.
Together, these results suggest that repo-Gal4 glia undergo at least one round of cell division, consistent with published studies -LSB- 27 -RSB-, -LSB- 28 -RSB-, and this proliferation becomes prolonged by constitutive coactivation of EGFR and PI3K signaling.
In fact, broad co-overexpression of dEGFRλ and dp110CAAX in neuroblasts and neuronal precursors -LRB- pros-Gal4 -RRB- reduced brain size, perhaps because signaling through these pathways stimulates precocious cell cycle exit of neuronal precursors, as in the developing eye -LSB- 33 -RSB-.
Tumors also contained trachea embedded throughout their mass -LRB- Figure 3D and 3E and Video S1 -RRB-, suggesting that tumors stimulated growth of new trachea or enveloped existing trachea, perhaps in a process akin to tumor angiogenesis.
We could not definitively determine if clones were derived from single cell events since our study of these clones was retrospective, but given the frequency of control clone induction, many mutant clones likely originated from single cells.
dPTEN - / - glia did not overgrow, but did show aberrant cytoplasmic projections -LRB- Figure 4D -RRB-, perhaps reflecting dPTEN function in the cytoskeleton -LSB- 38 -RSB-.
Cells from these double mutant clones appeared to invade the brain, typically following fiber tracts, and sometimes induced the formation of trachea -LRB- Figure 4E -RRB-.
We more commonly observed smaller dEGFR-dRas85D ; dPTEN - / - clones composed of relatively differentiated, enlarged glia with diffusely invasive projections -LRB- Figure 4G -RRB- ; these clones likely derive from glia that differentiated prior to achieving sufficient EGFR-Ras transgene expression, and are consistent with findings that not all glial subtypes become neoplastic.
Since neoplastic larval glia were concentrated in the outer anterior central brain and developing optic lobe, they may be derived from glial progenitor cells present in these regions -LSB- 27 -RSB-, -LSB- 28 -RSB-, -LSB- 39 -RSB-.
EGFR-Ras signaling can promote proliferation through Erk kinase-mediated induction of nuclear targets.
High levels of PntP1 can be detected normally in neuronal progenitors -LRB- data not shown -RRB-, suggesting that it promotes a proliferative progenitor state.
This suggests that TORC2 loss might antagonize glial neoplasia through dFoxO upregulation.
Myc protein levels can also be posttranslationally upregulated by EGFR-Ras-Raf signaling -LSB- 16 -RSB-, -LSB- 51 -RSB-.
Thus, we suspected that dMyc might mediate signal integration between EGFR-Ras and PI3K.
dMyc was also highly expressed in wild-type neuroblasts -LRB- Figure 7A -RRB-, suggesting that dMyc promotes a proliferative progenitor state -LSB- 21 -RSB-.
In fact, some dMyc + / - ; repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX animals were rescued to viability, indicating that dMyc is an essential rate-limiting output of EGFR-PI3K coactivation.
dCyclinD expression, which is high in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX glia, was inhibited by a dMycdsRNA -LRB- Figure 7F -- H -RRB-, suggesting that dMyc reduction suppresses glial neoplasia through reduced dCyclinD-dCdk4 activity.
dMyc-overexpressing glia showed polyploidy -LRB- Figure 8C, data not shown -RRB-, indicating that these cells undergo DNA replication without mitosis, but require additional signals for cell cycle progression.
In contrast, co-overexpression of dMyc with dEGFRλ produced a phenotype on par with that of repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX -LRB- Figure 8D -RRB-, indicating that dMyc overexpression can substitute for PI3K activation and promote neoplasia when combined with EGFR signaling.
Given that the dMyc targets dCyclinD-dCdk4 are required for dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX neoplasia, we tested whether dCyclinD-dCdk4 overexpression could cooperate with dEGFRλ.
Thus, glia likely require additional dp110 or dMyc effectors to undergo full neoplastic proliferation.
Our data imply that PI3K, dMyc, and dCyclinD-dCdk4 exist in a linear system, in which Rbf1 inactivation by dCyclinD-dCdk4 is one direct output of dp110CAAX or dMyc.
However, in high-grade glioma, Rb loss co-occurs with EGFR and PTEN mutations -LSB- 2 -RSB-, implying that these mutations cooperate to promote gliomagenesis.
This synergistic interaction likely derives from derepression of dE2F1 upon Rbf1 loss, and concomitant increased expression of dE2F1 target genes, including Stg and dCyclinE -LSB- 53 -RSB-.
Increased dCyclinE and Stg expression may accelerate cell cycle progression, perhaps through increased dCdk2 and dCdk1 activity and/or truncated G1 and G2 gap phases caused by constant dCyclinE and Stg protein levels -LSB- 23 -RSB-.
Phospho-MPM2 foci were present in glia of both genotypes, although repo > Rbf1dsRNA ; dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX brains appeared to have a higher density of glia with phospho-MPM2 foci -LRB- Figure S12 -RRB-, suggesting that expanded expression of dCyclinE results in broader activation of dCdk2.
This represents a robust organotypic and cell-type specific Drosophila cancer model in which malignant cells are created by mutations in the signature genes and pathways thought to be driving forces in a homologous human cancer.
When activated individually, these pathways fail to elicit glial neoplasia, implying a requirement for coordinated stimulation of multiple effectors and inactivation of negative regulators.
Orthologs for many of the genes within these pathways, such as dRictor, are implicated in human glioma, although specific roles for some, such as ETS transcription factors, have not been defined despite their expression in glioma -LSB- 2 -RSB-, -LSB- 57 -RSB-, -LSB- 58 -RSB-.
c-myc is commonly amplified in gliomas -LSB- 62 -RSB-, implying that Myc is rate limiting, and c-myc amplification may be selected for this reason.
Our data argue that Cdk4 activity is a key tumor-specific rate-limiting output of EGFR and PI3K signaling in glioma as well.
Rather, our results suggest that neoplastic cells arise from committed glial progenitors : dEGFR-dRas85D ; dPTEN - / - clones derived from progenitor cells produce large tumors, and anaplastic cells in repo > dEGFRλ ; dp110CAAX brains are concentrated in regions enriched for glial progenitors.
Further studies of Drosophila glial progenitors and glioma-like cells may illuminate the cellular origins of human gliomas, which are thought to arise from progenitor-like glial cells.
Moreover, our results argue that cell-type specific factors govern glial neoplasia.
One such factor may be Dap, the single p21/p27 ortholog, which is normally expressed in only 5 % of all glia -LRB- Figure S4 -RRB-.
Perhaps glial progenitors do not express Dap, whereas neuronal progenitors do -LSB- 26 -RSB-, and this underlies susceptibility to transformation by EGFR-Ras and PI3K.
Dap is highly regulated in a cell-type specific manner -LSB- 26 -RSB-, and studies of Dap regulation in glia may further illuminate the genetic origins of glioma, especially given that lack of p21 expression may underlie the tumorigenic response of mammalian glial progenitors to constitutively active EGFR -LSB- 65 -RSB-.
Such a system may be especially useful for distinguishing those genetic mutations and pathways that drive tumorigenesis from the large number of genes that show mutations and altered expression in glioblastomas uncovered by recent genomic analyses of patient samples -LSB- 66 -RSB-, -LSB- 67 -RSB-.
Our studies have already identified key rate-limiting genes, such as dCyclinE, Stg, and dMyc, and genes only required for abnormal neoplastic glial proliferation, such as dSin1, dRictor, and dCdk4, which may represent important therapeutic targets in human gliomas.
Figure S7 dEGFRλ and dp110CAAX do not induce neoplasia from neurons, neuroblasts, or certain glia.
Mitotic glia showed low levels of Repo -LRB- middle panels -RRB-, but are clearly GFP-positive -LRB- right panels -RRB-, suggesting that Repo protein expression is reduced upon mitosis in glia.
These dPTEN - / - ; dRas85DV12 cells appear to originate in the optic lobe -LRB- right -RRB- and extend variable tendrils into the central brain -LRB- middle, left -RRB-.
We used antibody microinjection and genetic manipulations to dissect the various roles of the homotetrameric kinesin-5, KLP61F, in astral, centrosome-controlled Drosophila embryo spindles and to test the hypothesis that it slides apart interpolar -LRB- ip -RRB- microtubules -LRB- MT -RRB-, thereby controlling poleward flux and spindle length.
The resulting mitotic defects, supported by gene dosage experiments and time-lapse microscopy of living klp61f mutants, reveal that, after NEB, KLP61F drives persistent MT bundling and the outward sliding of antiparallel MTs, thereby contributing to several processes that all appear insensitive to cortical disruption.
Among these mitotic proteins, the kinesin-5 motor is thought to play a key role -LRB- Cottingham et al., 1999 ; Valentine et al., 2006a ; Civelekoglu-Scholey and Scholey, 2007 -RRB-.
In yeast cells the homotetrameric structure of kinesin-5 appears to be essential for mitosis -LRB- Hildebrandt et al., 2006 -RRB-, and in Drosophila embryos KLP61F displays dynamic properties consistent with an association with spindle MTs -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB- and forms presumptive MT -- MT cross-bridges -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a -RRB-.
These results suggest that ensembles of multiple kinesin-5 motors could serve as dynamic cross-links that organize spindle MTs into bundles and drive a sliding filament mechanism that pushes apart antiparallel spindle MTs -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-, although alternative mechanisms of action for kinesin-5 motors have also been proposed -LRB- Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Tsai et al., 2006 ; Johansen and Johansen, 2007 ; Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.
This suggests that kinesin-5 may normally contribute to spindle bipolarity by sliding apart interpolar -LRB- ip -RRB- MTs to drive spindle pole separation during mitotic spindle assembly, elongation and function.
It is unclear if these findings are relevant to all spindles and if they all reflect the antiparallel MT sliding activity of kinesin-5, or if kinesin-5 functions differently in different systems as implied by the proposal that kinesin-5 functions as a MT depolymerase rather than a sliding motor to control chromosome congression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae -LRB- Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.
Biochemical evidence supports the idea that the prometaphase spindle is maintained by a KLP61F-Ncd force balance -LRB- Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, but it is unclear if the monoastral spindles form by the drawing together of focused poles due to Ncd-induced inward MT sliding or by the disorganization of spindle MTs combined with the fusion of microtubule organizing centers -LRB- Goshima and Vale, 2003 -RRB-.
We previously proposed that the KLP61F-driven outward sliding of ipMTs drives pre-anaphase B poleward flux and anaphase B spindle elongation -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-.
However, reductionist modeling -LRB- Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB- and system level modeling -LRB- Wollman et al., 2008 -RRB- surprisingly predicted that the rate of anaphase B pole -- pole separation is insensitive to the KLP61F concentration and is controlled instead by the unloaded KLP61F MT sliding velocity together with a pole-associated MT depolymerase.
Furthermore, it is unclear if some of these activities also require the activity of the overlying cortex, e.g., via cortical motors pulling astral MTs outward.
We find that kinesin-5 contributes to various aspects of mitosis in this system, some of which are novel and perhaps unexpected.
Briefly, we first crossed y -LSB- 1 -RSB- w -LSB- * -RSB- ; P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = UASp-GFPS65C-alphaTub84B -LCB- 14-6-II / P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = UASp-GFPS65C-alphaTub84B -LCB- 14-6-II with yw ;P -LCB- Act5C-Gal4 -LCB- / CyO, y + or w * ; P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = matalpha4-GAL-VP16 -LCB- V2H.
We selected P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = UASp-GFPS65C-alphaTub84B -LCB- 14-6-II / P -LCB- Act5C-Gal4 -LCB- or P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = UASp-GFPS65C-alphaTub84B -LCB- 14-6-II / P -LCB- w -LSB- + mC -RSB- = matalpha4-GAL-VP16 -LCB- V2H females and crossed them with w ; ln -LRB- 2LR -RRB- Gla,wgGla-1Bc1 / CyO males.
KLP61F antibody was generated against amino acids 900-1066, which includes the BimC box containing a mutation in which the putative phosphorylation site, Threonine 933, was mutated to aspartic acid.
Toward the bottom of the embryo, KLP61F-GFP is still present on the spindles and consequently these spindles assemble, though they may exhibit defects.
After KLP61F inhibition spindles collapse with a correlated increase in tubulin intensity, suggesting that MTs are sliding inward and not depolymerizing.
The increase is much higher than that observed in wild-type spindles, indicating that it is not due to a normal increase in tubulin.
Studies using transient transfection with Eg5 mutants in cultured Xenopus cells -LRB- Sawin and Mitchison, 1995 -RRB-, with KLP61F mutants in live Drosophila embryos -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB- and using antibodies raised against phospho - and unphospho-epitopes in Drosophila embryos -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a -RRB- suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved Thr-933 residue in the bimC box of kinesin-5 is critical for its localization to the spindle.
The latter result was intriguing because we had previously proposed that KLP61F-driven ipMT sliding drives anaphase B, yet in studying the gradient of intermediate phenotypes -LRB- Figures 1B and 2C -RRB-, we did not observe spindles that circumvented the prometaphase collapse but then failed to elongate normally during subsequent anaphase B..
This is, in fact, consistent with mathematical modeling predicting that the rate of anaphase spindle elongation is independent of the number of motors, at least above a low threshold number -LRB- Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ; Wollman et al., 2008 -RRB-.
We hypothesized that spindles containing sufficient KLP61F motor to circumvent collapse and progress through prometaphase might also contain enough motor to elongate the spindle at normal rates during anaphase B..
We further reasoned that, because Ncd generates an inward force capable of antagonizing KLP61F -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, in the absence of Ncd function, we might improve our chances of encountering spindles with sufficient KLP61F to proceed through prometaphase but below the threshold level of KLP61F needed to drive normal rates of anaphase B..
In such spindles, a decreased rate of anaphase B spindle elongation should be observed.
In uninjected mutants, pole -- pole separation occurred prematurely from prometaphase onward, supporting our hypothesis that Ncd serves as a `` brake '' that exerts an inward force on spindle poles, antagonistic to KLP61F -LRB- Figure 2D, dark blue -RRB-.
Pole -- pole separation in Ncd null embryos occurs shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown -LRB- NEB -RRB-, earlier than in wild-type embryos, suggesting that normally Ncd 's braking activity is turned on throughout prometaphase.
This result suggests that, when KLP61F and Ncd function are both missing, another inward force-generator must drive pole -- pole collapse.
In addition, spindles lacking the function of both motors are disorganized -LRB- Figure 2B -RRB-, suggesting that these motors contribute to spindle organization by cross-linking MTs throughout the spindle, in agreement with their localization in these cells.
This failure to elongate was not observed in anti-KLP61F -- injected wild-type embryos, and it supports the hypothesis that KLP61F is necessary for anaphase B..
We wanted to better understand if the spindle length defects we observe after loss of kinesin-5 function reflect defects in spindle pole separation -LRB- Saunders et al., 1997 ; Sharp et al., 2000a -RRB- or in spindle pole focusing -LRB- Gaglio et al., 1996 ; Goshima and Vale, 2003 -RRB-.
There was no obvious disorganization of the spindle poles, although some MT bundles appeared to `` splay '' laterally, projecting from the pole into the adjacent cytoplasm.
This indicates that ipMT bundles become thicker during the collapse, consistent with spindle shortening being due to an inward sliding of adjacent, antiparallel ipMTs, although serial section electron microscopy -LRB- EM -RRB- done at time intervals during the collapse, which is probably not feasible, would be required to establish this.
However, in the absence of real-time studies, it is unclear if these monoasters arise from an initial failure in spindle pole separation, from a collapse of assembled bipolar spindles, or from the fixation of transiently collapsing structures.
Other monoasters seem to form monoastral bipolar spindles, which may assemble via a chromosome-directed pathway in which KLP61F activity is required to focus the anastral spindle pole as proposed for S2 cells -LRB- Goshima and Vale, 2003 -RRB-.
These observations are consistent with the idea that KLP61F is required for the separation of spindle poles in the rapid, centrosome-dominant mitoses of the syncytial embryo, but as development proceeds, mitosis slows down -LRB- see below -RRB- and centrosomes become less dominant, so that KLP61F plays increasingly important roles in anastral spindle pole focusing.
Because the mutants examined are recessive lethal -LRB- Heck et al., 1993 -RRB-, this result makes it extremely unlikely that the collapse of prometaphase spindles seen after severe antibody inhibition is due to dominant effects of the antibody.
However, whether this difference in time reflects differences in the balance of forces operating in the spindles of different cell types or some other unknown factors is unclear.
Further evidence in support of the idea that KLP61F exerts outward forces on spindle poles was obtained by examining embryos carrying varying `` doses '' of the KLP61F gene -LRB- Figure 3C -RRB-.
For example, during prometaphase wild types harboring two copies of the KLP61F gene separated their spindle poles further than klp61f mutant heterozygotes containing a single copy, suggesting that the predicted increase in the concentration of the motor increases the outward force that pushes apart the poles -LRB- Figure 3C, left -RRB-.
In addition, the viability of klp61f mutants could be rescued with one or two copies of a KLP61F-GFP transgene that express the expected amount of protein based on immunoblotting -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB-.
On the basis of comparisons of the rates of poleward flux within ipMT bundles and the rates of MT sliding induced by purified KLP61F, as well as the observation that poleward flux stops at the onset of anaphase B, we previously proposed that KLP61F drives poleward flux in Drosophila embryos, but this had not been tested in vivo -LRB- Cole et al., 1994 ; Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-.
This indicates that KLP61F-driven MT sliding is necessary to achieve the wild-type metaphase spindle length and that it also contributes to poleward flux in both ipMTs and kMTs.
A possible source of negative flux numbers, especially close to zero, is noise in the measurements.
A more interesting possibility is that they represent speckles on ipMTs associated with one pole that slide inward as the spindle transiently shortens, bringing them closer to the pole in the opposite half spindle.
Such a speckle would flux toward the first pole but away from the second, now closer, pole, and this would be measured as negative flux.
-LRB- B -RRB- In embryos injected with anti-KLP61F antibody, kymographs obtained from spindles that did not collapse but maintained a steady length show that tubulin speckles do not flux toward the pole, indicating that the function of KLP61F is required for this movement -LRB- see Supplemental Video 2 for speckled movie -RRB-.
Significantly, the lower rate of 0.06 µm / s parallels the observed lack of poleward flux -LRB- previous section -RRB- and supports the idea that anaphase A is driven by a combined `` flux-pacman '' mechanism in Drosophila embryos -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Maddox et al., 2002 ; Rogers et al., 2004 -RRB-.
How loss of kinesin-5 function could lead to changes in the temporal relationship between chromosome-to-pole motility and spindle elongation during anaphase is unclear.
Cortical pulling forces could complement the outward sliding of ipMTs to control pole -- pole spacing.
If cortical dynein or cortical MT depolymerases play a significant role in pulling spindle poles apart by sliding astral MTs outward relative to the actin cortex, this activity should be reduced or eliminated due to the depletion of actin caps and furrows in these mutants.
This could reflect the sliding apart of MTs either by outward ipMT sliding by KLP61F or, during anaphase B, by outward pulling by cortical forces.
In wild-type spindles, speckles move at a rate of 0.05 ± 0.02 µm / s, in spg mutants they move at 0.05 ± 0.02 µm / s, and in sced mutants at 0.06 ± 0.02 µm / s -LRB- Supplemental Figure S1 -RRB-, indicating that outward pulling by cortical forces is not significant throughout metaphase and anaphase.
However, cortical pulling forces apparently do not play a significant role after metaphase onset, whereupon KLP61F becomes the major force generator for the outward sliding of ipMTs that underlies poleward flux and anaphase spindle elongation.
The work suggests that MT -- MT crosslinking and sliding by KLP61F contributes to 1 -RRB- the maintenance of prometaphase spindles as chromosomes are captured ; 2 -RRB- poleward flux in ipMTs and kMTs ; 3 -RRB- the bundling and organization of MTs throughout the spindle ; 4 -RRB- the control of pre-anaphase B spindle length ; 5 -RRB- tight congression, kinetochore -- kinetochore spacing and the rate of anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motility ; and 6 -RRB- the elongation of the anaphase B spindle in a manner that is relatively insensitive to the KLP61F concentration -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB-.
The hypothesis that KLP61F drives MT sliding from NEB through anaphase B to push apart spindle poles was also supported by gene dosage experiments in embryos and real-time fluorescence microscopy of transgenic late embryonic/larval klp61f mutants expressing GFP-tubulin.
The latter studies also revealed monoastral bipolar spindles that were never seen in syncytial embryos, suggesting that chromosome-directed spindle assembly becomes more evident as embryonic and larval development proceeds and mitosis slows down.
We propose that kinesin-5 motors function as ensembles of dynamic, transient, MT crosslinkers throughout the spindle -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999a ; Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB-, organizing parallel MTs into bundles -LRB- inset i -RRB- and sliding apart antiparallel MTs -LRB- inset ii -RRB-, in accordance with the biochemical properties of KLP61F -LRB- e.g., Cole et al., 1994 ; Kashina et al., 1996a ; Tao et al., 2006 ; Van den Wildenberg et al., 2008 -RRB-.
The results suggest that KLP61F-driven MT-MT sliding is required to oppose an inward force -LRB- ii, brown arrows -RRB- and maintain the spindle during early prometaphase, as well as to elongate it to the metaphase steady state length.
The kMTs may be slid poleward -LRB- dashed blue arrows -RRB- via crosslinks to the actively sliding antiparallel ipMTs.
The results support previous studies suggesting that KLP61F is dispensable for the assembly of astral syncytial embryo spindles but is essential for prometaphase spindle maintenance where it is antagonized by Ncd -LRB- Sharp et al., 1999b ; Sharp et al., 2000a ; Tao et al., 2006 -RRB-, and it further implicates the action of an additional, unknown, inward motor, possibly the MT depolymerase, KLP10A.
For example, in spindles lacking Ncd function, spindle collapse driven by the inward force-generators can be circumvented and the results, specifically the failure or delay of spindle elongation, then reveal a role for KLP61F-driven sliding in anaphase B..
In the spindles that fail to elongate, we propose that there is enough KLP61F to prevent spindle collapse but not enough to drive anaphase B -LRB- Figure 2 -RRB-.
An outward, KLP61F-driven ipMT sliding, coupled to MT depolymerization at the poles, could also underlie KLP61F 's contribution to poleward flux as predicted, but not previously tested -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 -RRB-.
Perhaps surprisingly, after partial KLP61F inhibition, flux is slowed down in all MT bundles, suggesting that all bundles are interconnected.
We propose that the sliding apart of ipMTs by KLP61F would also push kMTs poleward, if the kMTs are mechanically coupled to the sliding ipMTs by KLP61F -LRB- or other -RRB- MT -- MT cross-linkers -LRB- Figure 6 ; Sharp et al., 1999a ; Cheerambathur et al., 2008 -RRB-.
Depolymerization of ipMTs and kMTs at the poles would then create KLP61F-dependent poleward flux.
The slowing down of anaphase A chromatid-to-pole motility resulting from KLP61F inhibition could be explained by the loss of flux because it has been shown that in Drosophila embryos, anaphase A is driven by a combined flux-pacman mechanism -LRB- Rogers et al., 2004 -RRB-.
This may also be due to the loss of flux ; i.e., normally as MTs slide outward, they generate a pulling force on the kinetochores.
We hypothesize that the syncytial embryo spindles that we study are adapted for rapid mitoses -LRB- Civelekoglu-Scholey et al., 2006 -RRB- and consequently their assembly and function is dominated by the centrosome-directed pathway so that, unlike in larvae, S2 cells and many other cells, the chromosome-directed spindle assembly pathway plays a lesser role -LRB- Heald et al., 1997 ; Megraw et al., 2001 -RRB-.
The relative importance of centrosome - versus chromosome-directed spindle organization may be a key factor influencing how kinesin-5 is deployed in different spindles, e.g., in spindle pole focusing versus spindle pole separation, though it is obviously not the only factor.
Our results showing that KLP61F appears to contribute to the length of pre-anaphase B spindles in living embryos differ from the results obtained in fixed S2 cells where, above the critical concentration required for bipolar spindle assembly, increasing concentrations of KLP61F did not influence metaphase spindle length -LRB- Goshima et al., 2005b -RRB-.
Although we can not rule out an influence of technical differences between the two studies, we suspect that they reflect genuine system-specific differences, akin to the different consequences of loss of Ncd function in embryos versus cultured cells of Drosophila -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Goshima et al., 2005a ; Morales-Mulia and Scholey, 2005 -RRB-.
As in Drosophila embryos, the kinesin-5 motors appear to contribute to metaphase spindle length -LRB- Saunders et al., 1997 -RRB- and to anaphase spindle elongation -LRB- Saunders et al., 1995 ; Straight et al., 1998 -RRB-.
In some respects, therefore, the manner in which kinesin-5 is deployed in Drosophila embryos resembles yeast more closely than S2 cells, again possibly reflecting the relative dominance of centrosomes and spindle pole bodies.
In other respects the two systems may differ significantly ; for instance, although kinesin-5 contributes to congression in Drosophila embryos and yeast, the proposed underlying mechanisms are very different -LRB- Figure 6 and Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.
In vertebrate cultured cells, in contrast, the inhibition of Eg5 function led to only a 25 % decrease in the rate of poleward flux while spindle length remained normal, suggesting only minor contributions from kinesin-5 -LRB- Cameron et al., 2006 -RRB-.
The latter authors also reported a small decrease in kinetochore -- kinetochore spacing after Eg5 inhibition, supporting the notion that kinesin-5 may contribute to the exertion of poleward tension on kinetochores in some systems, including the Drosophila embryo -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB-.
However, in Dictyostelium amoebae and C. elegans embryos, kinesin-5 motors play relatively minor mitotic roles, and they appear to be dispensable for mitosis -LRB- Saunders et al., 2007 ; Tikhonenko et al., 2008 -RRB-.
Thus, mitotic motors can be deployed to carry out very different functions in different types of spindles, presenting a challenge for the formulation of general, integrated models of kinesin-5 function.
By cross-linking parallel MTs, KLP61F would `` zip '' together adjacent MTs to bundle and organize spindle MTs but would generate no force on them.
By cross-linking and moving toward the plus ends of antiparallel ipMTs, however, it would persistently slide them apart to drive poleward flux when ipMT sliding is balanced by ipMT depolymerization at spindle poles, or to exert outward forces on spindles poles when ipMT depolymerization is turned off -LRB- McIntosh et al., 1969 ; Sharp et al., 1999a ; Van den Wildenberg et al., 2008 -RRB-.
In the current study, this KLP61F-driven, outward ipMT sliding was directly visualized by monitoring fluorescent tubulin speckle behavior -LRB- Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 -RRB-, and it appeared to be antagonized by the inward sliding of ipMTs during prometaphase.
The results obtained with sponge and scrambled mutants, which have severely disrupted cortices, suggest that cortical organization, and by inference, the pulling activity of cortical force generators, do not play a significant role in spindle pole separation after NEB..
This is consistent with the hypothesis that KLP61F-driven outward sliding of ipMTs, augmented at specific stages by other ipMT-bound proteins such as KLP3A -LRB- Kwon et al., 2004 -RRB-, plays a central role.
We do not want to extrapolate our sliding filament model for kinesin-5 function in Drosophila syncytial embryos -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- to other systems where the molecular mechanism of action of kinesin-5 may be different -LRB- e.g., Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB-.
Elsewhere, many kinesin-5 motors have not been purified and studied biochemically, so it is possible that some kinesin-5 motors may act differently, e.g., serving as MT depolymerases -LRB- Gardner et al., 2008 -RRB- or sliding MTs relative to a spindle matrix -LRB- Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 -RRB-.
Further biochemical studies on the mechanism of action of purified kinesin-5 from multiple systems would obviously be fruitful.
Some discrepancies remain, e.g., the timing of activation of Ncd, but this is perhaps not surprising, given the inherent assumptions in such a broad theoretical approach.
We now understand that this model contains a physically unrealistic assumption in which an inward motion of the poles through increased depolymerization, coupled to decreased sliding, occurs in the absence of an associated force to drive this movement.
Of course, this imperfection would remain undetected if the same mechanism had been described only qualitatively, but it shows that this model requires further refinement to explain the KLP61F concentration versus spindle length data.
This work supports the idea that the KLP61F/Ncd force balance engages immediately after NEB as dynamic ipMT bundles start to form, whereas the subsequent elongation phase requires additional outward acting force-generators, for example, KLP3A on chromosome arms and cortical dynein -LRB- Sharp et al., 2000a ; Kwon et al., 2004 -RRB-.
Our own force-balance models for spindle assembly and function are based on the premise that antagonistic motors mediate the relative sliding -LRB- e.g., kinesin-5 and -14 -RRB- or depolymerization -LRB- e.g., kinesin-13 -RRB- of ipMTs, but other scenarios are also possible.
For example, a new `` slide-and-cluster '' model for anastral spindle assembly proposes that kinesin-5 transports MTs that assemble around chromosomes to the spindle poles where they are focused by minus-end -- directed motors -LRB- Burbank et al., 2007 -RRB-.
This model apparently generates a force-balance capable of maintaining a robust steady-state spindle length, and it provides a plausible description of chromosome-directed, anastral spindle assembly in Xenopus extracts and elsewhere, possibly including Drosophila late embryos/larvae and S2 cells.
However, in Drosophila syncytial embryo spindles, where MT assembly is nucleated predominantly at centrosomes, MTs turn over very quickly -LRB- half-time, 5 s -RRB-, and it seems unlikely that kinesin-5 would have sufficient time to transport MTs to the spindle poles for focusing there -LRB- Cheerambathur et al., 2007 -RRB-.
This suggestion again implies that kinesin-5 is deployed in different ways in different systems.
Failure to establish an appropriate balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of severe malaria.
To determine whether this balance is maintained by classical regulatory T cells -LRB- CD4 + FOXP3 + CD127 - / low ; Tregs -RRB- we compared cellular responses between Gambian children -LRB- n = 124 -RRB- with severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria or uncomplicated malaria infections.
Thus, while Tregs may not regulate acute malarial inflammation, they may limit memory responses to levels that subsequently facilitate parasite clearance without causing immunopathology.
These cells are more prevalent in children with uncomplicated malaria than in those with severe disease, suggesting that they may be the regulators of acute malarial inflammation.
While Tregs have been implicated in regulation of the immune response to chronic infections, their potential in determining disease outcome in acute infections is unclear.
In this study we have found that Tregs are unable to control the florid inflammation during acute, severe P. falciparum malaria infections, suggesting that this component of the immunoregulatory arsenal may be rapidly overwhelmed by virulent infections.
Further, we identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10-producing Th-1 effector cells and found that IL-10-producing Th-1 cells were associated with development of uncomplicated as opposed to severe malaria, leading us to suggest that such `` self-regulating '' Th-1 cells may contribute to clearing malaria infections without inducing immune-mediated pathology.
In addition, we found evidence that malaria-induced Tregs may limit the magnitude of malaria-specific memory responses detectable 28 days later, which may reduce the risk of immune-mediated pathology upon reinfection and may explain how immunity to severe disease can be gained after as little as one or two infections.
The clinical spectrum of P. falciparum infection ranges from asymptomatic parasite carriage to a febrile disease that may develop into a severe, life-threatening illness.
The factors that determine disease severity are not completely understood but are likely to include both parasite and host components -LSB- 1 -RSB- -- -LSB- 3 -RSB-.
Ultimately, the interplay between the parasite and the immune response likely determines the outcome of the infection -LSB- 4 -RSB-.
Although sterile immunity - completely preventing re-infection - is hardly ever seen and protection against clinical symptoms of uncomplicated disease is only acquired after repeated infections -LSB- 5 -RSB-, immunity to severe disease and death may be acquired after as few as one or two infections -LSB- 6 -RSB- suggesting that different immune mechanisms underlie these different levels of immunity.
While there is a growing consensus that killing of malaria parasites or malaria-infected red blood cells requires the synergistic action of antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses -LSB- 5 -RSB-, -LSB- 7 -RSB-, the mechanisms conferring protection against severe disease are less clear.
Given that pathology of severe disease has repeatedly been linked to sustained and/or excessive inflammatory responses -LSB- 4 -RSB-, acquiring the ability to regulate these responses adequately may be a key determinant of immunity that protects against severe disease -LSB- 8 -RSB-.
In summary, therefore, immunity against severe malaria may depend upon the host 's ability to regulate the magnitude and timing of the cellular immune response, allowing the sequential induction of appropriate levels of inflammatory - and anti-inflammatory cytokines at key stages of the infection.
Induced and/or activated in response to malaria infection -LSB- 27 -RSB-, Tregs may be beneficial to the host in the later part of the infection - when parasitaemia is being cleared - by down-regulating the inflammatory response and thereby preventing immune-mediated pathology.
On the other hand, if Tregs mediate their suppressive effects too early, this could hamper the responses required for initial control of parasitaemia, permitting unbridled parasite growth which may also lead to severe disease.
Malaria-specific induction of Tregs has been observed in a variety of experimental malaria infections in mice -LSB- 28 -RSB- -- -LSB- 31 -RSB-, but their role in preventing severe malarial pathology is unclear.
Depleting CD25 + cells of BALB/c mice infected with either P. berghei NK65 -LSB- 34 -RSB- or P berghei ANKA -LSB- 35 -RSB- reduced neither parasitaemia nor mortality, but increased the severity of symptoms in the diseased mice, suggesting at least some benefit from Tregs in this model.
Malaria naive individuals undergoing experimental P. falciparum sporozoite infection showed an increase in FOXP3 mRNA expression and expansion of Tregs 10 days after infection ; Treg induction correlated with high circulating levels of TGF-ß, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and rapid parasite growth -LSB- 27 -RSB- suggesting - but not proving - that Treg activation early in infection may inhibit the development of effective cellular immunity.
More recently, we have observed that Treg populations appear to be transiently expanded and activated during the malaria transmission season in individuals from a malaria endemic community -LSB- 36 -RSB-, again suggesting that naturally acquired malaria infection can drive the expansion and activation of Tregs.
However, although Tregs have been implicated in IL-10-mediated down-regulation of Th1-like responses in the placenta of malaria-infected women -LSB- 37 -RSB- and reduced Treg frequencies and function have been linked to enhanced anti-parasite immunity in certain ethnic groups in West Africa -LSB- 38 -RSB- the potential for Tregs to influence the clinical outcome of malaria infections is still unclear.
Interestingly, although we did not observe any significant differences in Treg numbers or function between severe and uncomplicated malaria cases, our data do indicate that malaria-induced Tregs may limit the magnitude of malaria-specific Th1 memory responses and thus moderate pro-inflammatory responses to subsequent infections, providing a possible explanation for the very rapid acquisition of immunity to severe malaria.
We suggest that these IL-10 producing effector T cells may contribute to clearing malaria infection without-inducing immune-mediated pathology.
On admission, only 12 -LRB- 9.4 % -RRB- patients had a white blood cell count -LRB- WBC -RRB- above the age-specific norm and there was no significant difference in median WBC count between uncomplicated and severe cases, suggesting that few if any children had a concomitant systemic bacterial infection.
Other factors potentially confounding immune responses, such as the degree of malnutrition or intestinal helminth infections were of similarly low prevalence in both severe and uncomplicated malaria cases and were not associated with severity of disease -LRB- Table 1B -RRB-.
We hypothesized that children with severe malaria would have fewer circulating Tregs than children with uncomplicated malaria, or that Tregs of severely ill children would be less active than those of children with uncomplicated disease.
Taken together, these data indicate that in both uncomplicated and severe cases of malaria Tregs are predominantly of a memory phenotype and are activated during acute malaria infection.
Finally, since high concentrations of TNF-α have been reported to impair Treg activity -LRB- by upregulating and then signaling via TNFR2, leading to decreased FOXP3 mRNA and protein expression -LSB- 46 -RSB- -RRB-, and the functional impairment of Tregs observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients can be reversed by anti-TNF-α antibodies -LSB- 47 -RSB-, we considered the hypothesis that the high levels of TNF-α seen in severe malaria patients -LSB- 13 -RSB-, -LSB- 15 -RSB-, might upregulate TNFR2 and impair Treg function.
Thus, our data seem to be more in line with data from mice suggesting that the interaction of TNF-α with TNFR2 on Tregs promotes their expansion and upregulation of FOXP3 -LSB- 48 -RSB- than with the data from studies of human rheumatoid arthritis.
Since the balance of T-effector to Treg responses is likely to be as important, or more important, than the absolute levels of either -LSB- 26 -RSB-, we compared the ratio of the levels of mRNA for the Th1 transcription factor T-BET with those for FOXP3, currently considered the best marker for Tregs, and the ratio of T-effector cells -LRB- defined as CD3 + CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 -, T-effector -RRB- over Tregs among the various groups.
The ratio of FOXP3 to GATA-3 -LRB- Th2 lineage factor -RRB- mRNA was similar for both time points in all groups -LRB- data not shown -RRB- but the Th1/Th2 ratio -LRB- T-BET/GATA -3 mRNA -RRB- was significantly higher during acute disease in children with CM, SA or SRD compared to those suffering from severe prostration -LRB- p = 0.0075 -RRB-, indicating that the expansion of the T-effector population is biased towards Th1 responses.
These data confirm previous studies indicating a shift towards a more inflammatory response during acute and severe malaria but, significantly, our data extend the previous observations by revealing that this inflammation is not balanced by a commensurate increase in Treg function.
Indeed, our data strongly suggest that the potent inflammation induced during an acute malaria infection overwhelms the normal homeostatic capacity of the immune system and, in particular, that the Treg response in children with severe malaria is insufficient to balance a much stronger Th1 effector response.
For both severe and uncomplicated cases, levels of IFN-γ mRNA were highly correlated with levels of IL-10 mRNA during the acute phase -LRB- severe : r = 0.833 p < 0.001, uncomplicated : r = 0.693 p < 0.001 -RRB-, suggesting that IFN-γ production is being balanced by IL-10 production.
Interestingly, IFN-γ mRNA levels on day 0 correlated with FOXP3 mRNA on day 0 for both severe -LRB- r : 0.39 p = 0.003 -RRB- and uncomplicated cases -LRB- r : 0.44 p = 0.0001 -RRB-, suggesting that IFN-γ may also be driving FOXP3 expression.
IL-10 is a crucial immunoregulatory cytokine in both human -LSB- 23 -RSB- and murine -LSB- 33 -RSB-, -LSB- 49 -RSB- malaria ; we have recently identified CD4 + T effector cells as a major source of IL-10 -LSB- 33 -RSB-, but the source of IL-10 in human malaria infection is unknown.
We therefore cultured freshly isolated PBMCs from 30 children with acute malaria -LRB- 17 severe, 13 uncomplicated -RRB- and 20 healthy control children, with or without PMA and Ionomycin -LRB- PI -RRB-, for 5 hours and analyzed them for the presence of intracellular IL-10 and IFN-γ by flow cytometry -LRB- Figure 6A -RRB-.
No cytokine production was observed in unstimulated cells -LRB- data not shown -RRB-, and PBMC from healthy children failed to produce any IL-10 in response to PI -LRB- data not shown -RRB-, indicating that stimulation with PI predominantly induces cytokine production from recently activated cells.
Taken together, these data indicate that during acute, uncomplicated or severe, malaria infections IL-10 producing cells are overwhelmingly T effector cells and that Th1 effector cells that also produce IL-10 are more prevalent in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria.
It has been reported that Tregs present at the time of infection -LSB- 54 -RSB- or vaccination -LSB- 55 -RSB- may restrict the development of subsequent Th1 memory responses.
To determine whether Tregs present during acute malaria infection might similarly affect the induction of immunological memory, we compared FOXP3 mRNA levels on day 0 with malaria specific IFN-γ memory responses -LRB- as assessed by PfSE-specific cultured ELISPOT -RRB- among PBMC collected from 34 of our convalescent malaria patients -LRB- 19 severe and 15 uncomplicated -RRB- on Day 28.
When plotted against FOXP3 mRNA levels measured on day 0, a linear by linear hyperbolic fit revealed that higher levels of FOXP3 mRNA on day 0 were highly significantly -LRB- p = 0.009 -RRB- associated with lower malaria-specific IFN-γ memory responses on Day 28, suggesting that Tregs induced during the acute infection may limit the magnitude of subsequent Th1 responses -LRB- Figure 7B -RRB-.
We hypothesized that the balance of inflammatory to regulatory immune responses would be biased towards a more inflammatory response in children with severe malaria than in children with uncomplicated malaria, that this balance would be restored during convalescence and -- crucially -- that this would be associated with differences in the proportion, absolute number or function of circulating classical -LRB- CD4 + CD127 - / lo FOXP3 + -RRB- regulatory T cells.
Given our previous observation of Treg expansion during the pre-patent phase of malaria infection -LSB- 27 -RSB-, we suggest that Tregs are induced/activated shortly after parasite emergence from the liver, that their numbers in peripheral blood then decline as a result of sequestration of CD4 + T cells during acute disease -LSB- 40 -RSB-, -LSB- 41 -RSB-, -LSB- 56 -RSB- and then, as has been described for other T cell subsets -LSB- 39 -RSB-, -LSB- 57 -RSB-, Tregs regain access to the circulation after malaria is cured.
Moreover, the Tregs circulating during acute malaria infections almost exclusively expressed an activated memory phenotype suggesting that they have expanded from a pre-existing pool of memory T-cells.
This interpretation would be in line with recent elegant work in humans demonstrating that Tregs are derived by rapid turnover of memory populations in vivo -LSB- 59 -RSB-, and with data from murine studies where, after CD25-depletion, malaria infection very rapidly drives differentiation of Tregs from circulating mature CD4 + T cells -LSB- 60 -RSB-.
Obviously, it would be of interest to study the relationship between Tregs and effector T cell kinetics and parasite biomass, which is not readily measurable.
Future studies may explore the usefulness of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein 2 in this context, which has recently been suggested as a surrogate marker for parasite biomass -LSB- 61 -RSB-.
Furthermore, the similar distortion in the T-BET/FOXP3 mRNA ratio during acute disease and the lack of any marked differences between the two groups in ratios of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the close correlation between IFN-γ and IL-10 in both groups which is in line with previous observations in experimental human malaria infections -LSB- 62 -RSB-, suggests that the systemic shift towards a pro-inflammatory immune response is similar in children with either severe or uncomplicated disease.
At first glance, these data do not appear to support the hypothesis that deficiencies in Treg function underlie the tendency of some children to develop severe, life threatening malaria.
However, we did observe significantly higher Th1 effector responses -LRB- more T-effector cells, higher concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α -RRB- in severely ill children than in children with uncomplicated disease, suggesting that the classical FOXP3 + Treg response that develops during acute malaria infection may be insufficient to balance the florid effector T cell response that develops particularly in children with severe disease.
This would be in line with evidence showing that as the strength of the inflammatory stimulus increases, the suppressive capacity of human Tregs declines and the resistance of T-effector cells to regulation increases -LSB- 63 -RSB-.
Intriguingly, the proportion of these cells within the total CD4 + T cell population was significantly higher in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria suggesting that in human P. falciparum infection, as in murine T.gondii infections -LSB- 50 -RSB-, IL-10 producing Th1 cells, activated by a strong inflammatory stimulus, may act as anti-parasitic effector cells with a `` built in '' control mechanism to prevent the onset of immune pathology.
If so, then the ability of these self-regulating effector cells to localize to sites of parasite sequestration in tissues, where they mediate parasite killing whilst simultaneously blocking tissue damage, may be key to clinical immunity to malaria.
Thus, our data strongly suggest that the percentage of IL-10-producing Th1 effector cells, rather than the cocktail of circulating cytokines, may be the most relevant biomarker of effective immunity to severe malaria.
Although -LRB- Tregs may not seem to determine the outcome of current P. falciparum infections -RRB- we did find evidence that they affect the magnitude of the malaria specific memory response induced by the current infection.
Thus, malaria specific Tregs acquired during a primary infection may limit the magnitude of Th1 effector responses to subsequent infections to a level that allows parasite clearance without causing immunopathology.
Future studies should be designed to test the hypothesis that Tregs may contribute to the very rapid development of resistance to severe malaria.
In summary, our data indicate that classical FOXP3 + Tregs are unable to control the florid inflammation that accompanies acute malaria infections and this component of the immunoregulatory arsenal is rapidly overwhelmed in children with either mild or severe malaria.
Importantly however we have identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10 producing Th1 effector cells which appear to be a major source of this key anti-inflammatory cytokine during acute malaria infection, and which are associated with development of uncomplicated as opposed to severe malaria.
We propose that IL-10-producing Th1 cells may be the essential regulators of acute infection-induced inflammation and that such `` self-regulating '' Th1 cells may be essential for the infection to be cleared without inducing immune-mediated pathology.
Moreover, we have found evidence in support of the hypothesis that Tregs limit the magnitude of the Th1 memory response raising the intriguing possibility that they may play an important role in the rapid evolution of clinical immunity to severe malaria.
Significance -LRB- measured at the 5 % level -RRB- tests for the effects of malaria group -LRB- uncomplicated, SA or SB -RRB-, time -LRB- day 0 and day 28 -RRB- and their interaction were adjusted for the possible confounding effects of age, sex, duration of prior symptoms and numbers of clones causing the infection.
To determine whether CBFß is required for AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 activity, we introduced amino acid substitutions into the Runt domain that disrupt heterodimerization with CBFß but not DNA binding.
CBFß enhances the affinity of the Runt domain for DNA by 7 - to 10-fold through quenching conformational exchange in several dynamic regions 31 -- 36 and may additionally inhibit Runx1 degradation mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway .37.
Inhibition or repression is presumably mediated by the recruitment of corepressor complexes interacting with ETO domains to genomic targets recognized by the Runt domain .11,12.
However, increasing evidence in cell line models suggests that the real situation may be substantially more complex .14,45 -- 48.
For example, it was proposed that AML1-ETO may function by sequestering transcription factors -LRB- such as E-box proteins -RRB-, SON, or other regulatory proteins into subnuclear compartments13 ,23 and that its DNA binding function may not be necessary .13.
It has also been proposed that AML1-ETO functions by dysregulating the expression of E-box protein targets .14.
Mechanisms invoking off-DNA activities including sequestration of transcriptional complexes and disruption of wild-type TEL function have also been proposed .58 -- 60.
-LRB- C -RRB- Diagram of the potential interactions between the Runt Domain, CBFß, and DNA.
Wild-type Runt domain -LRB- 45 µM -RRB- was titrated with 440 µM CBFß at 26 ° C, and 42 µM T161A or 38 µM Y113A/T161A were titrated with 396 µM CBFß at 22 ° C..
A triple Y113A/T161A/R174Q mutation in AML1-ETO did not further increase the percentage of Mac-1 + Gr-1 + cells compared with the individually mutated AML1-ETO proteins, indicating that the residual inhibitory effect of AML1-ETO resides in more C-terminal ETO sequences, and is not mediated through CBF binding sites.
Interestingly, it appears that the threshold level above which AML1-ETO can not tolerate disruption of CBFß binding and maintain clonogenicity lies above 60-fold, as the T161A mutant retains activity for at least 3 weeks in this assay -LRB- Figure 2D -RRB-.
Both aforementioned mouse studies reported that mutation of leucine 148 to aspartic acid -LRB- L148D -RRB- within the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, which disrupts DNA binding16 and presumably causes a severe disruption of domain stability ,30,65 resulted in a loss of cooperation with either oncogene .82,83.
These studies underscored the importance of the Runt domain for AML1-ETO 's cooperative activity, but did not address whether disruption of DNA binding, CBFß heterodimerization, or both were responsible for the observed effect.
We predicted that if mutations in AML1-ETO impaired its leukemogenic activity, the disease would more closely resemble the CMPD caused by TEL-PDGFßR alone.
However the BM contained many more differentiated myeloid cells such as neutrophils with ring-shaped nuclei -LRB- characteristic of CMPD -RRB-, presumably arising from the large population of EGFP-hCD4 + cells expressing TEL-PDGFßR alone -LRB- Figure 3E, F -RRB-.
We were able to transplant AML1-ETO plus TEL-PDGFßR expressing cells into secondary recipients and reconstitute the disease, but only using large numbers -LRB- > 2 × 106 -RRB- of freshly isolated splenocytes, and not with frozen cells -LRB- not shown -RRB-, indicating that the percentage of leukemia initiating cells was low.
Their average spleen sizes were similar to those of mice transplanted with BM expressing AML1-ETO plus TEL-PDGFßR or TEL-PDGFßR alone, and were significantly greater than those of mice transplanted with BM expressing AML1-ETO alone -LRB- Figure 3D -RRB-, indicating that TEL-PDGFßR contributed significantly to the splenomegaly.
The BM of all groups contained EGFP-hCD4 + and EGFP + hCD4 + cells, but relatively few cells expressing EGFP -LRB- AML1-ETO -RRB- alone, suggesting a competitive advantage for cells that expressed TEL-PDGFßR -LRB- Figure 3E -RRB-.
Interestingly, most mice -LRB- 19/24 -RRB- transplanted with cells expressing the AML1-ETO -LRB- Y113A/T161A -RRB- mutant contained an EGFPhihCD4 + BM population, presumably resulting from a selection for cells expressing high AML1-ETO -LRB- Y113A/T161A -RRB- levels -LRB- Figure 3E -RRB-.
We speculate that the Y113A/T161A mutant has residual activity and that more highly expressing cells partially overcome the effects of the mutations and thus are positively selected.
We suspect our inability to detect AML1-ETO was due to the relatively low percentage of AML1-ETO expressing spleen cells -LRB- Figure 3F -RRB-.
Interestingly, the FACS profiles of EGFP + hCD4 + BM cells from the AML1-ETO -LRB- Y113A/T161A -RRB- plus TEL-PDGFßR group were not identical to those of the AML1-ETO -LRB- R174Q -RRB- plus TEL-PDGFßR group and appeared to be intermediate between CMPD and AML.
For instance, there were fewer Gr1hiMac1hi cells in the AML1-ETO -LRB- Y113A/T161A -RRB- plus TEL-PDGFßR group, suggesting that granulocyte differentiation was somewhat more impaired -LRB- Figure 4A -RRB-.
These results indicate that the mutated AML1-ETO proteins were unable to appropriately regulate a subset of genes required for the development of AML.
To determine whether disrupting CBFß binding above a specific threshold results in functional impairment, we introduced mutations analogous to T161A and Y113A/T161A -LRB- T188A and Y140A/T188A -RRB- into TEL-AML1.
As the Runt domains of AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 are identical, we would expect the biophysical characteristics of the mutated proteins to be comparable.
It appears that, as was the case for AML1-ETO, a decrease in CBFß binding from 60 - to 400-fold is accompanied by a progressive impairment in TEL-AML1 's clonogenic activity.
We are optimistic that targeted disruption of either function may provide an effective therapeutic modality.
The more promising of the 2 interactions for small molecule inhibitors is that between the Runt domain and CBFß, since the Runt domain-DNA interface is highly charged and may be difficult to target with a small molecule.
The Runt domain-CBFß interface, on the other hand, contains a large hydrophobic area ,36,62 which should be more conducive for binding small molecules with drug-like properties.
A potential drawback to this approach is that the inhibitors would also further impair the function of the normal core binding factors, in which case there would need to be a therapeutic window for them to be clinically useful.
Alternatively, combined therapies using inhibitors targeting other functions specific for AML1-ETO -LRB- eg, oligomerization 15,49,87 -RRB- may provide specificity.
We find it encouraging that both AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 rely on CBFß for their activity, and therefore a single compound may prove efficacious in both disease settings.
In fact, we predict that all the Runx1 fusion proteins will require CBFß for their activity and that an inhibitor of the Runt domain-CBFß interaction may be useful for targeting all of these proteins.
For example, overexpression of a Drosophila Runt protein that could bind DNA but not CBFß dominantly inhibited its wild-type counterpart, suggesting that it was occupying its DNA binding sites but forming nonfunctional complexes .91.
Thus we speculate that CBFß participates in the formation of protein complexes that are necessary for AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1 function in vivo.
If this is the case, and if the nature of those complexes differs from those formed by the wild-type Runx1-CBFß heterodimer then other protein-protein interactions specific for the fusion protein complexes could lend themselves to targeting with small molecules.
It has been suggested that much of AML1-ETO 's activity may be mediated in a manner that does not require binding to Runx-dependent promoters .13.
Our data support the notion that some of AML1-ETO 's activity indeed does not require either DNA or CBFß binding, in that ectopic -LRB- retroviral -RRB- expression of a mutant defective in both functions could still significantly repress granulocyte differentiation of BM cells in vitro.
Since transcriptional activity is regulated by the posttranslational modification of transcription factors with the monosaccharide O-linked N-acetyl-d-glucosamine -LRB- O-GlcNAc -RRB-, we evaluated whether increased O-GlcNAcylation affects HIV-1 transcription.
Modulation of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation may play a role in the regulation of HIV-1 latency and activation and links viral replication to the glucose metabolism of the host cell.
Hence, the establishment of a metabolic treatment might supplement the repertoire of antiretroviral therapies against AIDS.
The dynamic interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation has therefore been proposed to control protein-protein interactions and protein functions.
In the meantime, other studies revealed that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 can also result in a reduction of transcriptional activation -LRB- 62, 77 -RRB-, indicating that the specific effect of O-GlcNAcylation on Sp1 activity strongly depends on the targeted promoter.
Thus, modulation of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation may be useful as a potential therapeutic approach for the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.
To exclude the possibility that reduced HIV-1 gene transcription is caused by impaired nuclear transport of the preintegration complex or reduced proviral integration, we evaluated the impact of GlcN treatment on the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity.
Assuming that O-GlcNAcylation alters the activity of transcription factors, Sp1 and NF-κB were prime candidates for the O-GlcNAc-mediated inhibition of the HIV-1 LTR.
These findings suggest that the presence of functional Sp1-binding sites is crucial for the inhibitory effect of OGT on the HIV-1 LTR.
Since the presence of the Sp1-binding sites is crucial for the inhibitory effect of OGT on the HIV-1 LTR promoter, we investigated whether this is also the case for the Sp1 protein itself.
To investigate the role of Sp1 in the OGT-mediated inhibition of the HIV-1 LTR in more detail, we explored whether overexpression of OGT enhances O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 -LRB- Fig. 6A -RRB-.
In order to determine whether O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits solely HIV-1 LTR activity or transcription in general, luciferase reporter assays were performed using LTR-Sp1wt and an EF1α promoter construct.
In contrast, the activity of the EF1α promoter was not repressed but significantly increased by OGT -LRB- Fig. 6B, EF1α -RRB-, suggesting that OGT selectively inhibits the HIV-1 LTR promoter and does not generally repress Sp1-regulated gene expression.
Furthermore, we evaluated by luciferase reporter assay whether the inhibitory effect of OGT on the Sp1-regulated HIV-1 LTR promoter is dose dependent.
The inhibitory effect of OGT on the HIV-1 LTR may rely on impaired nuclear translocation or decreased DNA-binding affinity of Sp1 upon O-GlcNAcylation.
The amount of nuclear Sp1 was not decreased upon overexpression of OGT -LRB- Fig. 7A -RRB- but rather increased, suggesting that the observed decrease in the HIV-1 LTR promoter activity was not due to impaired nuclear translocation of Sp1.
To investigate whether OGT interferes with the DNA-binding affinity of Sp1, gel shift assays were carried out with templates corresponding to the Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR promoter -LRB- Fig. 7B, wt LTR-Sp1 -RRB-.
Both antibodies shifted Sp1-C almost completely -LRB- Fig. 7D, lanes 4 and 7 -RRB-, suggesting that most of the DNA-bound Sp1 is O-GlcNAcylated in OGT-overexpressing cells.
Thus, we aimed to investigate whether increased OGT expression prior to infection may amplify the inhibitory effects on HIV-1 transcription in lymphocytes.
This effect appeared to be mediated by the transcription factor Sp1, as supported by several lines of experimental evidence.
This might be attributed to the compensation of Sp1-triggered gene transcription by other Sp family members, such as Sp3, which is also ubiquitously expressed and has the potential to activate transcription of certain otherwise Sp1-regulated promoters -LRB- 70 -RRB-.
These differential effects may depend not only on the individual composition of the transcription complexes at different promoters but also on differential Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation patterns in different transcription complexes.
The latter is supported by the fact that transcriptional corepressors recruit OGT to promoters -LRB- 78 -RRB-, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation is modulated directly at the promoter site.
As O-GlcNAcylation appears to have a yin-yang relationship with phosphorylation, the same may apply for O-GlcNAcylation.
Several mechanisms have been suggested for how O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits promoter activity.
Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylated Sp1 seems to act additionally as a repressor of HIV-1 transcription, as the presence of the Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR is crucial for the inhibitory effect of OGT.
The HIV-1 LTR promoter containing only functional NF-κB-binding sites but mutated Sp1-binding sites -LRB- LTR-κB-Sp1mut -RRB- was activated by OGT overexpression, indicating that O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB increases the transcription rate from the LTR-κB-Sp1mut promoter.
Accordingly, O-GlcNAcylation of NF-κB has been described and it was suggested to enhance the nuclear translocation of NF-κB -LRB- 21 -RRB-.
This indicates that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 inhibits the activity of the HIV-1 LTR in a dominant manner.
Unlike the NF-κB-binding sites, the Sp1-binding sites are well conserved throughout primate lentiviral LTRs -LRB- 18, 79 -RRB-, suggesting a conserved regulation of Sp1-mediated gene transcription for lentiviral LTRs, which is probably dominant over NF-κB regulation.
Furthermore, the dominant effect of Sp1 over NF-κB might be attributed to the synergistic mode of action of both transcription factors on the HIV-1 LTR -LRB- 59, 60 -RRB-.
A potential molecular mechanism for the dominant repressive effect of O-GlcNAcylated Sp1 on the HIV-1 LTR relies on the ability of Sp1 to recruit corepressors to the promoter.
Thus, O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 might quickly put initiated viral replication into a state of latency.
Most importantly, increased O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 prior to HIV-1 infection might efficiently prevent the onset of viral replication.
Altogether, these results suggest that O-GlcNAcylated Sp1 efficiently inhibits gene expression from the HIV-1 LTR and may be involved in the regulation of the viral life cycle.
Our results indicate that the O-GlcNAc level, and thus the glucose metabolism, may influence the life cycle of HIV-1.
Accordingly, inducers of Sp1 O-GlcNAcylation such as GlcN and 2-deoxyglucose, which are approved in clinical treatment of osteoarthritis and human genital herpes infections, respectively -LRB- 3, 61 -RRB-, may support HAART.
The establishment of a metabolic treatment may supplement the repertoire of antiretroviral therapies against AIDS.
A polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin -LRB- HTT -RRB- gene causes neurodegeneration in Huntington 's disease -LRB- HD -RRB-, but the in vivo function of the native protein -LRB- Htt -RRB- is largely unknown.
Numerous biochemical and in vitro studies have suggested a role for Htt in neuronal development, synaptic function and axonal trafficking.
Furthermore, removing endogenous dhtt significantly accelerates the neurodegenerative phenotype associated with a Drosophila model of polyglutamine Htt toxicity -LRB- HD-Q93 -RRB-, providing in vivo evidence that disrupting the normal function of Htt might contribute to HD pathogenesis.
Although Htt is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, HD mainly affects medium-sized spiny neurons in the striatum and to a lesser extent cortical pyramidal neurons that project to the striatum, suggesting that other cellular factors also contribute to pathogenesis -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998 -RRB-.
Recent studies indicate that an alteration of wild-type Htt function might contribute to this specificity and to subsequent disease progression -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.
Furthermore, wild-type Htt is proposed to have a neuroprotective role as expression of Htt can protect cultured striatal neurons from stress - and toxin-mediated cell death -LRB- Rigamonti et al., 2000 -RRB-.
Chimeric analysis demonstrated that the early embryonic lethality is the result of a crucial role of Hdh in extraembryonic membranes, as this lethality can be rescued by providing wild-type Hdh function in extraembryonic tissue -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 1998 -RRB-.
Conditional knockout of Hdh in the mouse forebrain at postnatal or late embryonic stages causes a progressive neurodegenerative phenotype, lending support to the hypothesis that depletion of normal Htt activity during disease progression contributes to HD pathogenesis -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 2000 -RRB-.
A more recent study in zebrafish, which used morpholino oligos to transiently knockdown endogenous Htt, suggests that Htt has a role in normal blood function and iron utilization -LRB- Lumsden et al., 2007 -RRB-.
No other domains have been identified in Htt to suggest a biological function for the protein.
In addition to the sequence similarity, other shared features support the proposal that the Drosophila gene identified in the study by Li et al. is indeed the fly homolog of human Htt -LRB- Li et al., 1999 -RRB-.
Although further studies are needed to elucidate the structure of the Htt proteins, this rather remarkable similarity raises the possibility of a conserved secondary structure among Htt family proteins and that both human and Drosophila Htt proteins are composed largely of repeated HEAT motifs.
Together, these data indicate that dhtt is widely expressed at low levels during all stages of Drosophila development.
At the subcellular level, ectopically expressed dHtt was found predominantly in the cytoplasm in transfected S2 cells and in larval tissues -LRB- Fig. 1G -- K and data not shown -RRB-, suggesting that dHtt, similar to its human counterpart, is mainly a cytoplasmic protein.
Since Htt homozygous knockout mice die during early embryogenesis -LRB- Duyao et al., 1995 ; Nasir et al., 1995 ; Zeitlin et al., 1995 -RRB-, we expected that loss of dhtt in the fly would be associated with prominent developmental defects.
The progeny derived from homozygous dhtt-ko flies did not show a reduction in viability or display other obvious developmental defects, suggesting that maternally contributed dhtt has no significant effect on animal development or function.
To determine whether developmental defects are present in dhtt-ko animals, we characterized dhtt-ko mutants using a variety of cellular and neuronal markers.
The exact nature of this phenotype discrepancy is not clear.
Given the experiment was carried out at 29 ° C, it is possible that the observed RNAi phenotypes were the result of cellular toxicity caused by the high-level expression of Gal4 -LRB- Gunawardena et al., 2003 -RRB-.
The more severe phenotypes might also be the result of the non-specific RNAi off-target effects caused by the knockdown of unrelated genes -LRB- Kulkarni et al., 2006 -RRB-.
Nevertheless, our results suggest that dhtt is dispensable for normal Drosophila development.
These phenotypic differences are probably the result of differences in mouse and fly embryogenesis, as the early lethality of Htt-null mice is due to the function of Hdh in extraembryonic membranes, for which there are no equivalents in Drosophila -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 1998 -RRB- -LRB- see Discussion -RRB-.
To test whether dhtt plays a role in synapse organization, we examined the formation of glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions -LRB- NMJs -RRB- in third instar larvae, a well-characterized system for studying synapse formation and function in Drosophila -LRB- Budnik and Gramates, 1999 -RRB-.
Together, these results suggest that dhtt is not essential for synapse formation and organization at NMJs.
Htt has also been proposed to regulate axonal vesicle transport because one of its binding partners, HAP1, interacts directly with p150Glued, which is an essential subunit of the dynactin complex involved in regulating dynein-mediated retrograde axonal transport -LRB- Engelender et al., 1997 ; Gunawardena et al., 2003 ; Harjes and Wanker, 2003 -RRB-.
Together, these results suggest that dhtt does not play an essential role in axonal transport.
We next investigated whether dhtt might function in adult animals.
We examined whether newly emerged dhtt adults were hypersensitive to stress tests including prolonged heat and cold exposure, vortexing and feeding with the oxidative stress compound paraquat.
The observed mobility and viability phenotype could be because of an underlying neurotransmission defect in dhtt mutants as several proposed Htt functions, such as axonal vesicle transport and clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neurons, are essential for the delivery and recycling of synaptic vesicles at nerve terminals to ensure effective neurotransmission -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Eaton et al., 2002 ; Harjes and Wanker, 2003 ; Hinshaw, 2000 ; Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000 -RRB-.
Together, these data suggest that dhtt is not essential for neurotransmission.
No change in the amplitude of PPF was observed in dhtt mutants, indicating that short-term plasticity is intact.
dhtt-ko mutants showed a more severe temperature-induced loss of phototransduction than control flies, suggesting that photoreceptors in aged dhtt-ko mutants were stress-sensitive compared with the controls.
To investigate whether the observed mobility and viability phenotypes in aged dhtt mutants are correlated with neuronal communication defects, we screened for electrophysiological phenotypes in animals aged 40 -- 45 days, when behavioral motor abnormalities are prominent.
To assess whether phototransduction can be maintained under an elevated temperature in dhtt mutants, we performed ERG recordings at 37 ° C..
Although dhtt mutants aged 1 -- 3 days displayed normal ERGs at both 20 ° C and 37 ° C, aged dhtt mutants displayed abnormal sensitivity to 37 ° C, with over 60 % of aged mutants losing light-induced phototransduction and the on/off transients at 37 ° C compared with only 20 % of control aged adults -LRB- Fig. 6E, F -RRB-, indicating an important role of dhtt in maintaining phototransduction under temperature-induced stress.
Given that aged dhtt mutant adults did not show additional motor defects when placed at 37 ° C, we hypothesize that the loss of photoreceptor depolarization found in ERG recordings reflects temperature-sensitive defects in the phototransduction cycle, rather than in synaptic transmission.
These results suggest that aged dhtt mutants are more sensitive to stress than young dhtt animals or aged controls.
However, in aged dhtt-ko mutants, it is apparent that the axonal termini contain a significantly reduced number of varicosities and branches -LRB- Fig. 7H, I, N -RRB-.
To rule out the possibility that this reduced complexity was because of the accelerated aging process or a secondary effect associated with the reduced mobility of dhtt-ko mutants, we examined the axonal termini of the A307-positive neurons in 83-day-old wild-type flies, as animals at this age are near the end of their life span and have severely reduced mobility.
The exact nature behind such a difference remains to be clarified, but might represent subtle alterations in axonal transport of membrane proteins in aged neurons.
Nevertheless, these results suggest that dhtt does not affect axonal pathfinding and overall brain organization, but has a functional role in regulating the complexity of axonal termini in the adult brain.
Further, existing evidence suggests that normal Htt activity can be inactivated by mechanisms such as abnormal sequestration into insoluble aggregates -LRB- Huang et al., 1998 ; Kazantsev et al., 1999 ; Narain et al., 1999 ; Preisinger et al., 1999 ; Wheeler et al., 2000 -RRB-.
These and other observations have lead to the hypothesis that the perturbation of endogenous Htt function, such as by late-onset inactivation of endogenous Htt, contributes to HD pathogenesis -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.
However, we have a unique opportunity to examine this in Drosophila because dhtt is not essential for fly embryogenesis and dhtt mutants appear to behave normally at young ages, with only a mild axon terminal defect in the brain.
The clear separation, along the midline, between the pair of medially projected ß-lobes, which was obvious in HD-Q93 flies -LRB- Fig. 9C, white arrow -RRB- -LRB- supplementary material Figs S7 and S8 -RRB- -LRB- n = 14 -RRB- and wild-type flies -LRB- Fig. 7J -RRB-, also became less distinct and often appeared to be merged in HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies -LRB- n = 13/18 -RRB- -LRB- Fig. 9H, white arrow -RRB- -LRB- supplementary material Figs S7 and S8 -RRB-.
The results obtained from quantifying the brain size of these flies suggested that, although the overall size of the brains was similar between HD-Q93 and HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies -LRB- Fig. 9M -RRB- -LRB- average brain size : HD-Q93 = 119,279 ± 2015 µm2, n = 7 ; HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko = 115,389 ± 2412 µm2, n = 7 ; P = 0.003 -RRB-, the total area that was devoid of neuronal cells was increased by about 25 % -LRB- Fig. 9N -RRB- -LRB- total area devoid of neurons cells : HD-Q93 = 26,324 ± 1869 µm2, n = 7 ; HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko = 32,945 ± 2494 µm2, n = 7 ; P = 0.03 -RRB-.
Together, these results suggest that there is increased disorganization and an increase in neuronal loss in the brains of HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko flies.
The white arrowheads highlight the clear separation, along the midline, between the two medial ß-lobes in the HD-Q93 ; dhtt-ko brain -LRB- C -RRB-, this is less distinct and appears merged in the HD-Q93 brain -LRB- H -RRB-.
As no other Htt homolog exists in the fly genome -LRB- Li et al., 1999 -RRB-, such a mild phenotype is unlikely to be caused by a functional redundancy resulting from another Htt-like gene in Drosophila.
Considering the evolutionary distance between Drosophila and mammals, such an observation might indicate that the Drosophila and mammalian Htt proteins, with their relatively restricted sequence homology, are not functionally conserved.
However, this phenotypic discrepancy might also reflect intrinsic differences during mouse and fly embryogenesis.
It is probable that Drosophila does not require equivalent tissues, such as extraembryonic membranes, to support its early development and that its embryogenesis can proceed normally in the absence of dhtt.
The absence of an Htt homolog in C. elegans suggests that Htt does not have a function that is essential for the development of invertebrates in general, which is in agreement with our observation that dhtt is dispensable for normal development of Drosophila.
Interestingly, a phylogenetic comparison of Htt proteins from different species postulates that Htt in the protostome -LRB- which includes Drosophilids -RRB- might be dispensable because, when compared with the deuterostome branch, evolution of the Htt genes along the protostome branch is more heterogeneous -LRB- Tartari et al., 2008 -RRB-.
Further studies will be required to determine whether the mammalian Htt gene can rescue Drosophila dhtt-null phenotypes.
Analyses of dhtt-ko mutants suggest that loss of dhtt does not affect synapse formation, neurotransmission or axonal transport -LRB- Figs 3 -- 6 -RRB-, which is in agreement with the absence of an Htt homolog in the worm, in which the essential components of these cellular processes are conserved.
It is possible that Htt still regulates these cellular processes, but with a minor role.
Extrapolating, there is a possibility that the function of Htt is associated with a novel cellular process and/or animal function that has been acquired during evolution.
Compared to the worm, Drosophila has a relatively long life span, a more complex nervous system and a more active life cycle, raising an intriguing possibility that the function of Htt might be directly related to these higher functions in adult animals.
Although dhtt is dispensable for normal Drosophila development, dhtt mutants show significantly reduced mobility and viability as they age, indicating an important role of dhtt in maintaining the long-term functioning and survival of adult animals -LRB- Fig. 5 -RRB-.
Targeted inactivation of Hdh in the mouse forebrain also causes a progressive neurodegeneration phenotype, suggesting that Hdh is required in the development and survival of neuronal cells -LRB- Dragatsis et al., 2000 -RRB-.
It remains to be determined whether common underlying molecular mechanisms are responsible for the observed brain phenotypes in the fly and mouse.
Nonetheless, considering the evolutionary distance between Drosophila and the mouse, the existence of structural defects in the adult brain in both species could indicate a conserved role of Htt in maintaining neuronal integrity.
Synapse complexity can be modulated by many factors, including neuronal activity and membrane and cytoskeleton dynamics.
In the future, many questions remain to be answered, such as the significance of this axonal terminal phenotype, the exact function of Htt in axonal termini complexity and the possibility of a causal link between this brain defect and the observed adult mobility and viability phenotypes.
Given that the distinctive neuronal loss observed in each polyQ disease is caused by otherwise unrelated disease genes that are widely expressed, it has been hypothesized that other cellular factors affect disease pathogenesis -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000 -RRB-.
In HD, accumulating evidence from cell culture and mutant mouse studies suggest that wild-type Htt has a neuroprotective function -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.
When endogenous wild-type Hdh is replaced by yeast artificial chromosomes -LRB- YACs -RRB- containing full-length human Htt with an expanded polyQ tract -LRB- YAC46, YAC72 and YAC128 -RRB- -LRB- Leavitt et al., 2001 ; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005 -RRB-, the mice develop massive cell death in the testes that can be suppressed by the wild-type Hdh gene, suggesting that the normal function of Htt might mitigate the cellular toxicity associated with the polyQ-expanded mutant Htt protein -LRB- Leavitt et al., 2001 ; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005 -RRB-.
In addition, a genome-wide study of HD animal models and postmortem tissues has shown that neuronal genes regulated by the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF, including the gene encoding BDNF, could be similarly repressed by either the presence of the polyQ-expanded Htt protein or by depleting endogenous wild-type Htt -LRB- Zuccato et al., 2007 -RRB-.
Together, these and other studies support the hypothesis that loss of normal Htt function affects HD pathogenesis.
It should be noted that our results do not directly demonstrate that loss of the endogenous Htt protein specifically affects HD pathogenesis, because the enhanced pathology might be the result of an additive effect of two detrimental factors in the animals, namely the presence of a toxic polyQ tract and the disturbance of the normal function of Htt.
Although dhtt-ko mutants exhibit only a mild age-dependent adult phenotype, it is possible that, in the absence of endogenous dhtt, some undetected cellular defects might develop that render the animals more susceptible to other cellular attacks.
In the presence of a toxic polyQ tract, this vulnerability might be exposed further, leading to additive phenotypes.
Our result is in agreement with the early hypothesis that HD might be caused by the combination of an acquired toxicity, conferred by the expanded polyQ tract in the mutated Htt, and an incurred neuronal vulnerability, arising from the loss of endogenous Htt function -LRB- Cattaneo et al., 2001 -RRB-.
Our data, together with previous mammalian studies, suggest that the normal function of Htt has a conserved neuroprotective role in the brain and that its depletion could render neuronal cells more vulnerable to the toxicity associated with the polyQ tract -LRB- Auerbach et al., 2001 ; Cattaneo et al., 2001 ; Dragatsis et al., 2000 ; Leavitt et al., 2001 -RRB-.
Given the devastating consequence of fully progressed HD, together with the observations that Htt-null neurons can develop and survive in the adult mouse brain and that dhtt-ko animals are largely normal with only mild adult brain defects, our data indicate that the benefit gained from balanced administration of RNAi knockdown therapy in the adult brain might justify the relatively mild loss caused by depletion of the Htt-associated neuroprotective function.
After generating transgenic flies with this dhtt minigene rescue construct, we crossed these animals into the dhtt-ko mutant background to test whether the mobility and viability phenotypes of dhtt-ko mutants could be rescued.
Our preliminary studies indicate that tick RNAi pathways may differ from that of other Arthropods such as insects.
The understanding of gene function in a poorly studied Arthropod such as the cattle tick Rhipicephalus -LRB- Boophilus -RRB- microplus -LRB- subphylum Chelicerata : order Acari : suborder Ixodida -RRB- can benefit from the knowledge generated by genome-wide resources of the model insect Drosophila melanogaster -LRB- subphylum Mandibulata : order Hexapoda : suborder Insecta -RRB-.
In addition, the tick genome size of 7.1 Gbp -LSB- 2 -RSB- compared to the D. melanogaster of 139 Mbp -LSB- 4 -RSB- will likely delay the generation of a complete R. microplus genome sequence -LSB- 5 -RSB-.
An additional phenomenon identified in plants and C. elegans is the systemic spread of RNAi from cell to cell throughout the organism and its potential systemic transfer to subsequent generations through the germ-line -LSB- 29-31 -RSB-.
Proteins related to this phenomenon in C. elegans include Sid-1, which encodes a multi-transmembrane domain protein thought to act as a channel for dsRNA uptake, and RNAi spreading defective proteins -LRB- Rsd-2, Rsd-3 and Rsd-6 -RRB- shown to be required for the systemic RNAi response -LSB- 32,33 -RSB-.
Originally, systemic RNAi was thought to be unique to C. elegans in animals, however preliminary evidence suggests that silkworm, honeybee, wasp and beetle utilize a Sid-1-like -LRB- sil -RRB- protein not found in mosquitoes or flies -LRB- reviewed by Tomoyasu et al -LSB- 14 -RSB- -RRB-.
RNAi pathways in Arthropods other than fruit flies and mosquitoes are beginning to demonstrate that there are evolutionary variations in these pathways with a higher level of divergence within the Arthropoda than previously thought -LSB- 14,38-41 -RSB-.
With the advent of increasing Arthropod genome resources, it may be feasible to identify more putative tick homologues of essential RNAi pathway-associated proteins to better elucidate the tick RNAi mechanism.
In this study we provide evidence for the presence of RNAi pathway associated proteins in R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genome reads, including a tick homologue for Dicer, Argonaute proteins, RdRP and proteins associated with dsRNA uptake and processing, and thus propose a putative tick RNAi pathway.
We then determined whether targeting genes in the cattle tick which are homologous to D. melanogaster genes with known RNAi in vitro phenotypes -LSB- 43 -RSB- would similarly result in abnormal phenotypes.
Evidence of putative RNAi pathway in R. microplus.
Another EST, TC6448 encodes the putative Piwi domain of the Cat-Ago-1 protein, which has 46 % identity with the Piwi domain of D. melanogaster Ago-1.
The R. microplus Ago-2 homologue TC984 -LRB- TC9244/TC16832, BmiGI2 -RRB- identified by de la Fuente et al -LSB- 37 -RSB- was also confirmed in our search and appears to encode a Piwi domain.
We identified putative hits to Rsd-3 and Epn-1 in both R. microplus and I. scapularis with 45 % and 48 % -LRB- Rsd-3 -RRB- and 71 % and 43 % -LRB- Epn-1 -RRB- identities, respectively.
It must be noted that only one SN domain was identified in the putative homologue which either indicates that it is not a true TudorSN homologue or that the consensus sequence is currently incomplete.
However, a recent GenBank submission indicates the presence of a putative I. scapularis TudorSN identified simultaneously with this study -LRB- -LSB- GenBank : EEC18716 .1 -RSB- Ixodes scapularis Genome Project Consortium -RRB-.
Figure 5 shows a schematic diagram of a putative tick RNAi pathway.
Putative proteins identified in R. microplus ESTs have been described using the ` Cat' -LRB- Cattle tick -RRB- prefix.
It is yet unconfirmed whether a SID-1 or Sil-1 homologue exist in ticks, however, it is feasible that RdRP and associated proteins are involved in germ-line spread similar to the C. elegans RdRP pathway -LSB- 28 -RSB-.
Here we postulate the potential amplification of both trigger dsRNA and secondary siRNAs through the involvement of a Cat-RdRP.
A definitive dsRNA binding protein -LRB- such as D. melanogaster R2D2 or C. elegans Rde-4 -RRB- potentially associated with Dicer was not found using the current tick sequence resources.
Other proteins putatively associated with dsRNA uptake, systemic or germ-line RNAi listed in Table 1 were not included in this diagram.
Schematic representation of a putative tick RNAi pathway.
To validate further a putative functional RNAi pathway in R. microplus we conducted RNAi-mediated loss-of-function assays in vitro and in vivo.
The putative function of these 13 R. microplus ESTs were then assigned by retrieving the annotated InterPro domains of their Drosophila counterparts -LRB- Table 2 -RRB-.
Evaluation of the assigned functional information revealed that 5 sequences putatively have a role in ribosome and protein synthesis -LRB- TC5762, TC9037, TC12306, TC12372, TC12393 -RRB-, 4 in proteasome and ubiquitinylation -LRB- TC6372, TC9852, TC10417, TC13930 -RRB-, 3 in DNA binding -LRB- TC6116, TC12182, TC9417 -RRB-, and one in energy and metabolism -LRB- TC5823 -RRB-.
It is feasible that the TC13930 treatment may have had a stronger viability phenotype if the knockdown had been more effective -LRB- only 31 % compared to other treatments ~ > 79 % -RRB-.
As the viscera from only one tick per treatment was harvested for RT-qPCR, it is feasible that the TC9037 treatment on this single tick was not delivered successfully, however, none of the 5 ticks injected produced viable eggs indicating a knockdown phenotype for the TC9037 treatment overall.
Thus 9 of the 10 Drosophila tick homologues demonstrated either a lethal effect on reproduction or a reduction in larval hatching rates when using dsRNA targeted knockdown in vivo.
The lack of tick genome sequence resources has limited the ability to mine for RNAi protein homologues however research to date has suggested that ticks utilize a dsRNA-mediated RNAi similar to that described in insects such as flies and mosquitoes -LSB- 47,48 -RSB-.
De la Fuente and colleagues -LSB- 37 -RSB- postulated a model for tick dsRNA-mediated RNAi following the identification of a putative Ago-2 protein in the R. microplus EST database.
Our results support the diagram represented in de la Fuente et al -LSB- 37 -RSB- demonstrating evidence for putative tick Dicer, RISC associated proteins and dsRNA uptake homologues, however we identified a R. microplus EGO-1 homologue known to be implicated in RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity previously not identified in animals other than C. elegans.
To provide an evolutionary perspective to demonstrate relationships within the Ecdysozoan infraphylum it is important to note that their common ancestors may have existed over 1 billion years ago -LSB- 49 -RSB-.
As differences between RNAi pathway mechanisms between C. elegans and D. melanogaster are evident, it is thus feasible that Chelicerates could also vary from insects albeit their evolutionary distance is less -LRB- ~ 500 million years -RRB- -LSB- 2 -RSB-.
In this study we identified one putative tick Dicer in the I. scapularis genome reads however evidence for more than one Dicer can not at this stage be confirmed.
Our preliminary evidence points to a ` single' tick Dicer with yet un-confirmed structure, though until complete tick genome resources are available the presence of more than one Dicer can not be entirely dismissed.
The functions of these tick Argonaute proteins remains to be confirmed and further research is required to identify the full complement of tick PPD proteins.
Perhaps an RdRP-based RNAi amplification mechanism within the Ecdysozoans -LRB- including ticks and C. elegans -RRB- is common, but lost in insect species ?.
An additional aim of our study was to investigate whether fruit fly RNAi screens of conserved genes could be associated with similar tick phenotypes and tick gene function.
We used a stringent search to enable the selection of the most similar sequences to maximize the probability of selecting a tick sequence which following dsRNA mediated knockdown could also affect growth and viability in vitro.
Perhaps uptake of nucleic acids by cultured tick cells is less efficient than with Drosophila cells.
This suggests the recruitment of different receptors for dsRNA uptake in tick cells compared to those described in Drosophila.
It is also possible that the cell line types utilized in D. melanogaster and R. microplus are not directly comparable and functionally different.
The 438 genes targeted by Boutros and co-workers -LSB- 43 -RSB- compared the effects using 2 embryonic cell lines, Kc167 which is an ` early' embryonic cell line and S2R + which is a ` late' embryonic cell line -- potentially more comparable to BME26 cells which are ` late' embryonic in origin -LSB- 55-57 -RSB-.
Perhaps the fact that we chose highly conserved homologues increased the probability of success in our in vivo experiments compared with C. elegans.
However, it is clear that tick in vitro RNAi analysis using BME26 can not be directly correlated to available Drosophila in vitro data, unless perhaps only target genes with higher z scores -LRB- as demonstrated here for ubiquitin-63E -RRB- can be studied to increase the probability of a phenotype correlation.
Other tick dsRNA studies have used cDNA clones -LSB- 42 -RSB- as templates for amplification and subsequent transcription verifying that perhaps the tick genomic DNA templates are not amenable for high throughput gene amplification required for RNAi functional screens.
The presence of complex intronic/exonic structure can inhibit satisfactory PCR amplification of gDNA possibly due to poor primer binding.
It may be feasible to develop short interfering RNA treatments which would be simpler to prepare than long dsRNA treatments for difficult templates such as the tick, to date siRNAs have not been applied in R. microplus loss-off-function assays.
Long dsRNA gene silencing can also lead to off target effects and false positive RNAi phenotypes -LSB- 60,61 -RSB-.
Until complete annotated tick genome resources are available, false positive knockdown resulting from long dsRNA treatments and the specificity of -LRB- siRNAs -RRB- tick RNAi reagents can not be confirmed.
We utilized the existing R. microplus BmiGI2 database -LRB- 13,643 ESTs -RRB- and the I. scapularis genome reads to identify 31 putative tick RNAi proteins which confirmed the presence of a putative Dicer, RISC associated, dsRNA uptake and RdRP proteins in ticks and constructed a putative tick RNAi pathway.
Apart for proteasome/ubiquitinylation homologues, it was not feasible to replicate D. melanogaster embryonic cell culture RNAi functional data in R. microplus BME26 embryonic cells.
This could either be attributed to transfection/uptake issues and/or a difference in cell types in the fly and tick embryonic cell lines.
The findings in this manuscript support the fact that perhaps the Chelicerates may not be amenable to modeling based on insect pathways -LRB- Subphylum Mandibulata -RRB- as perhaps expected for Arthropods.
Until more tick and related genomes -LRB- mites and spiders -RRB- are available, such comparative studies within these Subphyla are not feasible.
Sequences with a similarity of at least 80 % and an e-value less than e1-50 were selected, conceptually translated and their putative function was further analyzed by assigning GO terms using InterProScan -LSB- 63,68,69 -RSB-.
Together our findings support the idea that axons are delivered to particular regions of the neuropile by their responses to systems of positional cues in each dimension.
This work revealed that there might be additional cues operating in a similar fashion in the dorso-ventral axis of the nerve cord.
The extent to which these processes depend on target specific signals as opposed to pervasive guidance cues, to which many different neurons can respond, is far from clear.
Thus it is clear that there must be cues operating in the neuropile that deliver terminals to these specific destinations within the forming network.
However, the neuropile is a 3-D structure and there must therefore be additional cues that determine the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior termination domains for each axonal and dendritic arbor.
Sensory terminals that are shifted experimentally along the medio-lateral axis of the neuropile maintain their characteristic dorso-ventral location in their new position, suggesting that the factor that determines this position may be a `` dorso-ventral '' patterning cue that is present at different positions in the medio-lateral axis.
In this model, termination sites depend on the response of axons to a system of positional cues that dictate the behaviour and final location of many, perhaps all terminals within a developing network of pre - and postsynaptic neurons.
The Drosophila Embryonic Neuropile Can Be Divided into Four Dorso-Ventral Layers, Which Are Likely to Have Distinct Functions in Information Processing.
The Plexin overexpression phenotypes suggested that their Sema ligands might act as cues to position the terminals of neurons along the dorso-ventral axis of the forming neuropile.
We conclude that the motorneuron dendrites are likely to be a source of Sema 1a in the dorsal neuropile.
We conclude that the GABAergic interneurons are likely to be a significant source of Sema 1a in layer 1 and also in layer 3.
We have so far been unable to identify cellular populations that project exclusively to layer 2, but since the expression is continuous across the midline -LRB- see Figure S2A -RRB-, at least some midline cells could be involved.
One possibility is that the recently described extensions of midline glial cells, the gliopodia -LSB- 30 -RSB-, might provide a vehicle by which high levels of Sema 2a are deployed across the developing neuropile.
Thus a source of the Sema 2a gradients could potentially be a subset of the midline cells, although we can not exclude the possibility that some other cells are the endogenous source of this cue in the CNS.
We now asked whether sema 1a and sema 2a are required to confine class IV projections to layer 4.
Sema 1a appears to play a more important role in preventing termination in layer 1, followed by layer 3, and a minor role in preventing termination in layer 2.
Sema 2a appears to play a more important role in preventing termination in layer 2, and a minor role in preventing termination in layers 1 and 3.
Our results suggest that Sema 1a and Sema 2a are instructive for termination of class IV axons along the dorso-ventral axis.
We also assessed the potential roles of Sema 1a and Sema 2a in controlling the termination of class IV axons in the antero-posterior axis by analysing their projections in a top-down view of the neuropile in wild type and in sema 1a, sema 2a double mutants -LRB- Figure S7 -RRB-.
In top down view, class IV terminals do appear disorganized compared to wild type, but we assume this disorganization is a consequence of the major defects in growth and termination in the dorsoventral axis.
Thus Sema 1a and Sema 2a do not appear to play a major role in confining class IV terminals to the anterior portion of the segment.
Thus, rather than a requirement to act as a cue, the class IV mutant phenotypes could reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Sema 1a in the sensory neurons themselves.
We also asked whether restoration of Sema 2a expression in the midline glial cells using the single mindedGAL4 line in an otherwise sema 2a mutant background -LRB- sema 2a, UAS-sema 2a ; single-mindedGAL4, ppkeGFP -RRB- rescues the sema 2a mutant phenotype of class IV axons -LRB- see Figure S4 for details of these experiments -RRB-.
The experiments we describe suggest that both Sema 1a and Sema 2a are required as cues to confine class IV sensory axons to ventral neuropile.
Thus, a combination of Plexins could be required in ventrally projecting sensory neurons to exclude them from dorsal and central neuropile.
To show whether both Plexins are required to exclude the ventrally projecting sensory neurons from central and/or dorsal neuropile, we analysed the projection pattern of class IV axons in plex A and B mutants.
This suggests that Plex B may normally have a role in preventing termination in layers with high levels of Sema 2a or Sema 1a and may therefore be a functional receptor for both ligands.
We also observed that embryos transheterozygous for plex B and either sema 1a -LRB- sema 1a / + ; plex B / + -RRB-, sema 2a -LRB- sema 2a / + ; plex B / + -RRB-, or plex A -LRB- plex B/plex A -RRB- all exhibit class IV termination phenotypes, indicating a genetic interaction between these mutations -LRB- unpublished data -RRB-.
To further test whether Plex B functions to prevent termination in regions with high Sema 1a levels we analysed the patterns of sensory terminals that overexpress Plex B in a sema 1a mutant -LRB- Figure S9 -RRB-.
A similar expansion is also observed in plex ADf -LRB- 4 -RRB- C3 mutants, indicating that Plex A function is required to prevent termination in regions with highest levels of Sema 1a -LRB- Figure S9C -RRB-.
To exclude -LRB- a -RRB- the possibility that plex A and B are required in the central targets of sensory neurons, in which case the mutant phenotypes might be a result of aberrations in normal target directed growth and -LRB- b -RRB- the possibility that Plex A and B are acting as guidance cues we restored their expression selectively to sensory neurons using the P0163 GAL4 driver.
In a system in which neither the axonal nor dendritic terminals are constrained by the cell bodies or by the position of entry of the main dendrite or axon trunk into the neuropile, we envisage that connectivity develops in stages with an initial phase in which growing axons and dendrites are both delivered to appropriate volumes of the neuropile, followed by a phase of targeted connection between appropriate pre - and postsynaptic partners.
A pattern of growth of this kind would resemble that seen in the developing olfactory system of the adult fly where coarse targeting to particular regions of the antennal lobe is followed by precise recognition and matching between axons and dendrites -LSB- 36 -RSB-, -LSB- 37 -RSB-.
Alternatively it may be that the mechanisms that pattern the growth of fibres representing a single modality such as olfaction are different from those required to organise the distribution of terminals within a highly heterogeneous network such as that seen in the VNC.
In our view the initial delivery and restriction of fibres to particular subvolumes of the VNC neuropile is likely to be by individual growth responses to generalised systems of cues that operate to pattern the network as it develops.
Our initial approach of using a misexpression screen targeted to all sensory axons was sufficient to reveal the existence of the Semas as putative cues in the dorso-ventral axis by showing that there were generalised redistributions of sensory endings in this axis when the cells concerned were forced to express either of the two Sema receptors, Plex A or Plex B..
In the developing Drosophila embryo selective overexpression of the putative receptors for Sema 1a and Sema 2a in sensory neurons acts in a predictable fashion to exclude sensory axons and terminals from those regions where the ligands are highly expressed : overexpression of Plex A excludes projections from high levels of Sema 1a expression in layers 1 and 3.
These findings suggest that Sema 2a and Sema 1a provide guidance cues to the growth cones of sensory neurons that express Plex A and Plex B..
This suggests that the growth cones of these cells are attracted towards to midline -LRB- we assume by Netrins -RRB- -LSB- 39 -RSB- as soon as they enter the CNS, but that entry and termination in the more dorsal region of the neuropile is prevented by high levels of Sema 1a in layer 1.
Loss of plex A appears to affect class IV terminals less strongly than loss of sema 1a.
One explanation could be that Plex B might also function as a receptor for Sema 1a in this system.
High levels of Plex B signalling thus appear to be able to substitute for the absence of Plex A signalling and prevent expansion into regions with high Sema 1a levels.
These findings could be explained if Plex B were to function as a lower affinity receptor for Sema 1a, as well as a high affinity receptor for Sema 2a.
Sema 1a and Sema 2a are unlikely to be the only cues that operate in the dorso-ventral axis.
The incomplete penetrance of the termination phenotype in the sema 1a, sema 2a double mutant suggests that additional factors may operate to control the ventral targeting of class IV axons.
There may be long range ventral attractants or local substrate bound attractive cues for these axons in the neuropile.
It is also likely that dorsally and centrally located sensory and interneuron terminals, as well as dendrites of motor neurons may require additional signals to exclude them from ventral neuropile.
Such signals could be the other Semas.
Alternatively, by analogy with the optic tectum, where Wnt signalling drives dorsal projections and Ephrins dictate ventral projections, it is possible that some other signalling system may operate with Semas to confine dorsally projecting neurons to dorsal neuropile -LSB- 3 -RSB-, -LSB- 40 -RSB-, -LSB- 41 -RSB-.
Our findings suggest that much of the Sema 1a expression in the neuropile of the VNC is on the surfaces of motor neuron dendrites and on the projections of the GABAergic interneurons.
Thus, there appear to be two kinds of positional cues in the neuropile.
Slit and Sema 2a are examples of secreted and possibly glia-mediated positional cues.
Thus, the presentation of repellent molecules on the surfaces of subsets of neurons can act to exclude specific classes of axons from particular regions of the neuropile.
They suggest that similar mechanisms that are used for the establishment of neural maps, only involving generalized positional cues in each dimension, control targeting of many different classes of neurons to specific termination domains within a complex neuropile.
Although the evidence we provide here suggests that positional cues can specify particular domains for the termination of sensory neurons, we do not suppose that the control of termination and branching by a pervasive system of positional cues would necessarily be sufficient to allow connections to form selectively and specifically between appropriate pre - and postsynaptic partners.
What such a system does provide is a framework of signals that could regulate simultaneously the growth of axons and dendrites of many different neurons and induce their termination and branching in appropriate parts of the developing network.
Within these restricted regions it is likely that further, localised mechanisms, including competitive interactions, patterns of activity, and target derived cues might all be required to control synaptogenesis and determine the emergence of precise patterns of connectivity within a termination domain.
If the pattern of sensory axon termination within the neuropile is controlled by a system of positional cues, most likely, in three dimensions, it may well be that the location of their postsynaptic dendrites is determined in a similar fashion.
It will then be possible to make a direct investigation of the molecular mechanisms that control the termination and branching of pre - and postsynaptic endings and thereby lay out a ground plan for connectivity within the developing neuropile.
Thus, the position of termination in the neuropile does not seem to depend on the nerve through which the sensory neurons travel towards the neuropile nor on the position of entry into the neuropile.
-LRB- A -RRB- Levels of Sema 2a are uniform along the antero-posterior axis, thus Sema 2a is unlikely to provide instructive information for controlling neurite termination along this axis.
Thus Sema 1a is unlikely to provide instructive information for controlling neurite termination along this axis.
Thus the source of the Sema 2a gradients could potentially be a subset of the midline cells, although we can not exclude the possibility that some other cells are the endogenous source of this cue in the CNS.
These structures are thicker than the axon itself and we assume they contain presynaptic specialisations.
We assessed the potential role of Sema 1a and Sema 2a in controlling termination of class IV axons in the antero-posterior axis by analysing their projections in a top-down view of the neuropile in wild type and in sema 1a, sema 2a double mutants -LRB- see Figure S5A and S5B -RRB-.
We assume the observed disorganization is a consequence of the major defects in growth and termination in the dorsoventral axis.
Thus Sema 1a and Sema 2a do not appear to play a major role in confining class IV terminals to the anterior portion of the segment. -LRB- 1.15 MB TIF -RRB-.
Plex B may therefore function as a receptor for Sema 1a.
We propose that the existence of the alternative alignments, specific to distinct groups of genes, suggests presence of different synchronization modes between the two organisms and possible functional decoupling of particular physiological gene networks in the course of evolution.
Comparative analysis of evolutionary changes in distant organisms at the level of gene expression requires cross-matching -LRB- alignment -RRB- of temporal microarray data covering developmental time courses or cell cycles.
In addition, aligned temporal datasets can reveal concordantly and discordantly expressed pairs of orthologous genes or groups of genes.
Our analysis suggested that evolutionary shifts in durations of G1/G2 cell cycle phases are manifested in the expression timing of replication machinery and ribosomal genes.
Based on the amplitude of gene expression in the course of the life cycle, all genes in the yeast genome can be conditionally separated into -LRB- i -RRB- cell-cycle dependent -LRB- oscillating -RRB- -LRB- ii -RRB- constitutively expressed and -LRB- iii -RRB- inducible -LRB- not expressed or expressed constitutively in our datasets -RRB-.
Low oscillating and constitutive genes contribute less or no information to the global alignment, moreover, their actual expression dynamics can be masked by the internal noise.
However, several factors, such as biased contribution of synchronization approaches, short duration of the datasets -LRB- two cell cycles -RRB- and high internal noise can make Fourier analysis fail for many genes, which, in fact, do cycle significantly.
Statistical model for SNR takes into account assumption that periodically expressed genes would gradually increase or decrease expression level from one time point to another.
The SNR filtering reduced the initial number of the orthologous profile pairs in the selected datasets -LRB- α-factor - S. cerevisiae vs. cdc25 - S. pombe -RRB- to 3193 or otherwise to 2518 genes in S. pombe and 2169 genes in S. cerevisiae -LRB- see ortholog matching in Methods -RRB-.
An apparent contradiction between the previously reported number of cycling genes -LRB- 500 -RRB- -LSB- 18 -RSB- and the number of genes investigated in this study -LRB- > 2000 -RRB- is explained by the fact that all significantly changing profiles -LRB- high variance -RRB- were scored in our study, even if they displayed moderate Fourier power at the desired period -LSB- see Additional file 1 - Figure S5 -RSB-.
We believe that in most instances low Fourier scores reflected biased expression at the start of the cell culture synchronization, desynchronization of cells after several cycles and/or measurement errors.
This test provided evidence that periodicity is present in the additional genes, as compared to prior studies, although it might be masked by the noise or conditions of the culture synchronization.
We explored the pairwise alignments to see whether there are alternative alignment paths, common to certain groups of genes expressed discordantly with respect to the global alignment -LRB- idea first proposed by J. Aach and G. Church -LSB- 1 -RSB- -RRB-.
From the biological standpoint, the time clusters correspond to synchronization groups ; within each group, the expression synchrony among all genes is maintained during evolution, while synchrony between the groups -LRB- time clusters -RRB- is apparently lost -LRB- see Figure 3A - C -RRB-.
Synchronization between the replication machinery, ribosomal and housekeeping genes suggests coordination between the cell division and the cell growth -LSB- 22 -RSB- in both yeast species.
Such desynchronization or heterochrony observed between the mitochondrial and the ribosomal/replication genes can be attributed to the semi-autonomy of mitochondria and the mitochondrial gene expression -LSB- 23 -RSB-.
Mitochondrial biogenesis in S. pombe is more similar to higher eukaryotes -LSB- 24 -RSB-, so it is quite possible that the independent synchronization of some mitochondrial genes is maintained in higher eukaryotes as well.
Apparently, since then, some of the mitochondrial pathways -LRB- respiration, ribosome biogenesis -RRB- maintained their own, internal, synchronization of gene expression.
Phase shift in expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial ribosomal genes detected in this study -LRB- see Figure 3G-J -RRB- appears to support hypothesis of decoupling of oxidative and reductive biochemical pathways in the yeast cell cycle -LSB- 26,27 -RSB-, and possibly represents an example of heterochrony -LSB- 28 -RSB- at the level of gene expression.
Recent studies in the evolutionary genomics field suggested presence of conservation between sub domains of large gene networks -LSB- 29-31 -RSB-.
In this work, comparative analysis of gene expression dynamics has shown that parts of large gene networks -LRB- presumably corresponding to time-clusters -RRB- maintained substantial temporal synchrony in the course of evolution.
One possible reason for this is the dramatic rewiring of regulatory pathways during evolution.
The following factors may limit the area of application : -LRB- i -RRB- variability in gene expression under different experimental conditions -LRB- synchronization method, -LSB- see Additional file 1 - Figure S10 and Table S2 -RSB- ; -LRB- ii -RRB- strikingly different alternative alignment paths, specific to large group of genes -LRB- heterochrony, see Figure 3 -RRB- ; -LRB- iii -RRB- distortion of gene expression profiles as the result of normalization and Gaussian smoothing.
Upsampling is a standard way of converting analog signals to digital, new sample rate should be at least 2 × higher than the highest frequency in the original signal -LRB- Nyquist - Shannon sampling theorem -RRB-.
Gaussian filter was used to remove high frequencies, much higher than frequencies related to the cell cycle, assuming that the high frequencies are noise.
Together, upsampling and Gaussian filtering might have effects similar to the interpolated time warping described earlier -LSB- 1 -RSB-.
Corpora annotated with information concerning this behaviour can constitute a valuable resource in the training of IE components and resources.
Initial experiments have also shown that the corpus may viably be used to train IE components, such as semantic role labellers.
Both types of word behave in similar ways, in that they specify arguments that can convey a range of different types of information related to the event.
• Range of events - whether a single type of event or multiple event types are annotated.
• Event arguments - the number and types of arguments -LRB- i.e., participants -RRB- in each event may be fixed or flexible.
More detailed information types, e.g., location, time or experimental setup may or may not be identified as event arguments.
• Scope of events - whether event arguments must occur within a single sentence or whether they may occur across multiple sentences.
• Semantic information assigned to arguments - this may correspond to named entity types and/or semantic roles.
In the case of semantic roles being assigned, they may be tailored to a particular type of event, or they may apply to a large range of different events.
Some studies -LRB- e.g., -LSB- 34,35 -RSB- -RRB- have shown that, to a certain extent, general language resources can also be useful in the training of SRLs for biomedical texts, due to the fact that many verbs appear in texts from both the general language and biomedical domains, and often behave in similar ways.
However, the cited works concede that, whilst such SRLs may produce adequate results for certain predicates, training using biomedical corpora is also needed.
• Verbs/nominalised verbs that occur in both the general and specialised language domains may have different syntactic and semantic properties in each domain, e.g., differing numbers of arguments -LSB- 38 -RSB-, as well as different meanings.
This is important since, according to -LSB- 20 -RSB-, and as confirmed by us through consultation with biologists, types of information such as location, manner, timing and condition, which can appear in various syntactic positions, are all essential for describing biomedical relations.
Although their application to general language may be problematic -LSB- 30 -RSB-, the use of a closed set is viable in a restricted domain, as domain-specific definitions can be provided for each semantic role type.
The values of the semantic roles may be specified either as specific words or phrases -LRB- e.g., E. coli or NifA -RRB- or more general named entity categories -LRB- e.g., GENE -RRB-.
Initial machine learning experiments using the GREC -LSB- 45 -RSB- suggest that it can be used to train IE components with reasonably good performance, with both named entity extraction and semantic role labelling having achieved F-scores of around 60 %, based on 10-fold cross validation.
A further direction of research which could help to improve the performance of IE systems trained on the GREC is introduced in -LSB- 46 -RSB-, in which it is demonstrated that, due to the differing perspectives of different annotation schemes, it is not always the case that larger corpora contain the most useful information.
The reported study found that, whilst small corpora may not be large enough to train IE systems in their own right, augmenting such corpora with training instances derived from other corpora can help to improve the performance of the trained system.
This provides convincing evidence that combining smaller, richly annotated corpora, such as our own, with larger corpora which are slightly poorer in information content, could provide a future direction of research for training more accurate biomedical IE systems.
This idea is especially attractive, given that the production of large, richly annotated corpora can be very time consuming.
1 -RRB- In Escherichia Coli, glnAP2 may be activated by NifA.
For each event, two types of information may be specified in the text, both of which are important to its correct interpretation :.
• Higher level information -LRB- called modality -RRB- about how the event should be interpreted.
The current annotation effort is concerned with events relating only to gene regulation or expression, i.e., events that describe any interaction which leads, either directly or indirectly, to the production of a protein.
Annotators were helped by -LRB- but not restricted to -RRB- a list of verbs which we created that potentially denote gene regulation and expression events.
The automatic extraction was carried out by identifying those verbs whose syntactic arguments corresponded either to terms identified by the TerMine tool -LRB- http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/ -RRB- or biological named entities identified by the GENIA tagger -LSB- 55 -RSB-.
We concluded that arguments of gene regulation and expression events may be characterised using a subset of these general language roles, with the addition of the domain-specific CONDITION role.
For our own purposes, we created 2 separate roles, DESCRIPTIVE-AGENT and DESCRIPTIVE-THEME, and extended the characterisation of these roles to apply not only to predicatives, but also to any argument which describes characteristics or behaviour of either the AGENT or the THEME of the event.
In general, definitions of argument types normally specified as adjuncts, such as MANNER, INSTRUMENT, CONDITION and LOCATION, can be problematic to distinguish from each other.
The aim of this is to allow queries over extracted event instances to be performed at different levels of granularity, i.e., users could specify more general or less general concept types according to their requirements.
IHF may inhibit ompF transcription by altering how OmpR interacts with the ompF promoter.
The AGENT of encoded may be viewed as any of the following spans : Klebsiella rcsA, Klebsiella rcsA gene, or The Klebsiella rcsA gene.
Similarly, the THEME could be polypeptide, a polypeptide or a polypeptide of 23 kDa.
According to our guidelines, annotated text spans should normally consist of -LRB- sequences of -RRB- complete chunks, thus alleviating many issues relating to the exact words that should be included within an argument text span.
This means that, for example, in the above sentence, the AGENT of encoded should be chosen as The Klebsiella rcsA gene, as this corresponds to a complete NP chunk.
The tool is designed to support many kinds of annotation of text documents, and can be adapted to new tasks fairly straightforwardly by producing new Java classes that define the task.
Linguistic expertise would be acquired through the training programme and through study of the annotation guidelines.
When the species referred to in the abstract was changed -LRB- from E. coli to human -RRB-, this resulted in a drop in agreement rates for most tasks, particularly bio-concept assignment, suggesting that a period of adjustment is required when switching to a new species.
Two tasks, however, i.e., semantic role assignment and argument identification, seem more domain-independent, in that the agreement rates stayed constant, or even continued to rise slightly, when the species referred to in the text was changed.
Differing levels of experience in gene regulation may have caused annotators to vary in their ability to accurately assign fine-grained biological concept categories.
In each case, events centred on these 10 words constitute 45 - 50 % of the total events annotated, suggesting that the majority of relevant events are centred on a relatively small set of words.
In other cases, there appears to be a stronger preference for either the verb or the nominalised verb.
However, the fact that the Underspecified role was only assigned 11 times in the whole corpus suggests that our originally-defined role set is sufficient to characterise the vast majority of semantic arguments.
Whilst it may seem surprising that only about half of the events specify an AGENT, this can partly be explained by the relatively high occurrence of events that are centred on nominalised verbs -LRB- 42 % of all events -RRB- and passive constructions -LRB- 14 % of events -RRB-.
This suggests that more specific concept type assignment for genes can be problematic.
As these are the subtasks that we originally identified as being more linguistically-oriented than others, our results suggest that a detailed set of guidelines, together with an intensive training programme, allow these tasks to be carried out by biologists to a high degree of accuracy.
Most of the other role types occur much less frequently in the corpus -LRB- varying between 1-5 % of events -RRB-, meaning that the agreement rates shown may be less reliable.
Thus, there may be a need to more carefully balance conciseness with comprehensiveness in the guidelines.
A particular example is the word mutation, which can be used either as a nominalised verb -LRB- i.e., the action of mutating -RRB-, or as an entity -LRB- e.g., a mutated gene -RRB-.
However, the distinction can sometimes be problematic.
In sentence 1 -RRB-, a particular envZ mutation seems to describe a mutated entity rather than the action of mutation.
In the following sentence, Alpha interferon should be seen as the AGENT of converting as well as the AGENT of stimulates :.
LOCATION arguments can also be problematic in sentences containing multiple events.
The confusion may occur because anaerobic can be used in the description of environmental conditions in a phrase such as under anaerobic conditions.
Whilst this would normally be interpreted as a CONDITION, the confusion may have arisen due to the use of when at the beginning of the phrase.
According to the guidelines, one of the situations in which DESCRIPTIVE-THEME should be assigned is to objects of verbs that describe states rather than actions e.g., The fru operon contains the genes for IIFru.
However, problems sometimes arose for certain verbs such as exhibit, where there may be some confusion as to whether a `` state '' or `` active '' interpretation should be taken, e.g., The wild-type and mutant ompR genes exhibit different phenotypes of osmoregulation ....
The interpretation taken by the annotator determines whether different phenotypes is assigned the role THEME or DESCRIPTIVE-THEME -LRB- and also whether The wild-type and mutant ompR genes is assigned AGENT or THEME -RRB-.
In general, DESCRIPTIVE-THEME and DESCRIPTIVE-AGENT have less strict definitions than other roles, in that the only restriction imposed is that they should be assigned to arguments that describe characteristics or behaviour of the AGENT or THEME.
This, together with the fact that they are not particularly commonly occurring, could have made them more difficult to assign accurately.
As future work, we will consider tightening the definitions and possibly splitting them into different roles.
Although it is desirable to keep the set of roles used as small and as general as possible in order to ease the burden on the annotator, a slightly larger range of more tightly-defined roles may help to improve agreement rates.
This suggests that some annotators were using the Protein category to encompass all things related to proteins, rather than assigning more specific category labels.
This may be related to their differing levels of knowledge regarding gene regulation and expression.
It is also hoped that the corpus will boost research into other areas of bio-IE, such as the production of domain-specific SRLs, which have previously suffered due to the lack of a suitably annotated corpus.
There is also evidence to suggest that combining the GREC with other larger biomedical corpora may help to train more accurate IE systems.
A full examination of the problematic cases will allow us to further improve the guidelines and possibly impose further restrictions in the annotation software, to prevent common types of errors being made.
As regards biological concepts, our results show that, although high levels of agreement can be achieved when considering a coarse-grained set of categories, the use of a fine-grained classification caused some difficulties.
This is possibly due to the differing levels of expertise of annotators within the gene regulation and expression domain, which may have resulted in varying levels of confidence in assigning more specific concepts.
A solution for further phases of annotation would be to analyze the domain knowledge of annotators in greater detail and, where appropriate, provide extra training in the assignment of more specific categories.
This may be combined with a re-evaluation and possible simplification of the concept hierarchies.
Whilst other event types may require the use of alternative biological concepts or ontologies, we would like to verify that our set of semantic roles is applicable to events in other areas of biomedicine.
The texts we will consider will also include full texts, in which events may be expressed in different ways from abstracts, and may involve different -LRB- higher -RRB- numbers of arguments.
Putatively functional motif occurrences are mapped onto a representative domain, given that a high quality reference SCOP domain structure is available for the protein itself or a close relative.
They are found in a diverse range of proteins, such as membrane receptors, adaptors, scaffolds and transcription factors, and mediate numerous tasks, which can be as disparate as directing subcellular localization or acting as sites of cleavage.
Although classification tools can not definitely confirm a motif as functional -LRB- only experimental analysis can achieve this -RRB- they can be used to attach a level of confidence to a motif.
For example motifs which occur in an incorrect cellular compartment, or outside the known taxonomic range, are unlikely to be functional as are those which are not conserved in closely related proteins or buried in a globular domain inaccessible for interaction.
It also indicates less likely matches that lie within globular domains annotated in the SMART -LSB- 26 -RSB- and Pfam -LSB- 27 -RSB- resources and contrasts these with intrinsically unstructured polypeptide -LRB- IUP -RRB- regions predicted by GlobPlot -LSB- 28 -RSB- that are more likely to be motif-rich -LSB- 5 -RSB-.
This observation suggests that stringent examination of motif structural context should be an essential processing step for experimental analysis.
It also advocates the importance of high quality tools to identify such cases, as the cost associated with failure is detrimental both in terms of effort and quality of the literature.
Benchmarking of the structure filter suggests that deeply buried LM candidates are unlikely to be functional, and that the likelihood of motif matches being valid functional sites improves with accessibility.
In this way, the new filter can aid researchers to decide whether they wish to invest effort inexperimentaltesting of candidate motifs.
In order that the structure filter may be a useful guide to the ELM resource user, we propose that the values of the above-mentioned parameters are used as decision-making tools in evaluating the score of LM predictions.
In particular, since having high accessibility and belonging to loop regions is not a prerogative of LMs alone and the random match dataset might in principle be `` contaminated '' by not yet annotated spurious true motifs, we suggest using as many indicators as possible in evaluating a prediction score and not relying on each single tool as a unique criterion for retaining/rejecting a prediction.
In order to establish if one score is more discriminative than the others, we assigned an accessibility score -LRB- Qacc -RRB-, a secondary structure score -LRB- Qsse -RRB- and a combined score -LRB- Qand = Qacc + Qsse -RRB- to the true positive instances of our dataset and to the random matches of the random dataset, plotted cumulative score distributions and ROC curves and calculated the area under the ROC curves -LRB- AUCs -RRB-.
In calculating the ROC curves, we assumed that random matches are all negative matches.
This p-value, which is implemented both in the Web Server and in the Web Service, is calculated using a Z-test and is a conservative estimate of the probability that a LM prediction with a given score is a true positive ; more specifically it is the probability of obtaining a random match with a score at least as high as the one that was actually observed, and therefore we expect it to be very stringent.
These background distributions are only intended as a supplementary guideline for the web users to evaluate whether or not the score assigned to a LM match is reasonably higher than the random match score average for that LM.
We consider that such a three-interval scheme might effectively help the user in deciding whether to retain or reject a prediction.
In fact it is based on the idea that a predicted match that is assigned a score in the `` enriched '' interval will be indicated by our procedure as a good true motif candidate -LRB- i.e. likely to be a valid functional site -RRB-, motif matches scoring in the bottom interval -LRB- `` sparse '' interval -RRB- as unlikely to be valid functional sites and those ranking in the middle one as `` neutral ''.
From Figure 4 and Table 3, it can be seen that, in the case of the accessibility score -LRB- Figure 4a -RRB-, the cut-off on the top 30 % of true motifs implies that only 10 % of random matches are retained in the enriched bin and that the cut-off on the lower 40 % random matches implies that only 15 % true motifs incorrectly fall in the `` sparse '' bin.
This gives to the users a measure of the percentage of false hits that they can expect in the enriched bin and of the percentage of true hits that they would miss if discarding all the predictions falling in the sparse interval.
In evaluating Sn, Sp and Accuracy, we assumed that a match belonging to the negative set and scoring above the `` accept '' threshold, is a FP and one scoring below, is a TN ; a true instance scoring above the `` accept '' threshold is a TP and one scoring below is a FN.
Since the structure filter is designed as a guide to experimentation, we consider that sensitivity should be privileged over specificity - for not missing too many true motifs.
Notice that the Accuracy values reported in Table 4 might be affected by the fact that the positive and negative datasets are unbalanced.
The analysis of the ROC curves, of the cumulative distributions and of the filter performance in the three score bins suggests a more relevant role of the accessibility in discriminating true from false motifs than the secondary structure assignment.
This observation is biologically sound since, while a buried motif is unlikely to be a genuine functional site, an exposed motif lying e.g. on a helix can in any case possess an interaction ability.
For practical purposes, the filter exploits available information on protein structures to answer the question `` Is it worth testing this motif candidate experimentally ? '' rather than to categorically tell the users whether they have a real motif or not.
In deciding if a prediction is a good experimental candidate, the user should give more weight to accessibility score than to secondary structure score since a buried motif is unlikely to carry a function, whereas an exposed motif may function properly even if it is part of a beta strand or belongs to a helix -LRB- see examples in the benchmarking dataset, additional file 6 -LRB- Table S1 -RRB-.
If there is evidence of allostery, however, depending on which parts of the structure are flexible, this might support or invalidate the motif.
If nothing is known, then it should be kept in mind that most parts of most globular domains do not undergo major rearrangements, hence candidates from the sparse bin should not be eyed with hope.
Is the motif conserved, at least within a phylogenetic lineage such as mammals, tetrapods or vertebrates : the motif should be conserved in such groups if it is functional in a regulatory system common to related organisms.
Structure files may contain large protein complexes, single proteins, single or multiple chains, single globular domains and many other types of molecule.
LMs may be bound to their ligands or in an unliganded state.
The dependency of LM accessibility on globular domain rearrangements implies that multi-domain structures are not a suitable structural unit for structure filtering.
The appropriate units therefore in the cases of LMs would be the individual globular domains themselves.
At least for domains that do not undergo allosteric rearrangement, a motif which is buried in the core of a structural domain unit is unlikely to be a true one.
Eight out of 36 LM entries have at least one instance which is entirely or almost entirely in helical conformation while two entries have at least one instance almost entirely in a strand conformation.
Nevertheless, the function of proteins can be regulated by an assortment of different mechanisms, and allosteric modifications or unusual LM position and/or conformation are infrequent but possible.
In this sense, we encourage the user to carefully evaluate the possibility that a hidden motif can become exposed upon protein interaction and to use the ELM structure filter cum grano salis, i.e. not as a deterministic predictor but rather by exploiting the supplied 3D information on LM predictions as a supplement to a prior knowledge of the LM biological context.
The disorder predictor GlobPlot highlights potential motif-rich regions that are likely to be intrinsically unstructured.
In future, we may also consider introducing a predictive accessibility filter into ELM for poorly characterised globular peptide segments.
Thus, the experimental strategy adopted to detect functional motifs plays a fundamental role and incorporating some simple stratagems in experimental protocols might crucially help in reducing the number of false motifs in the literature.
Check if the motif mutation unfolds the protein by cloning in a tagged expression construct that allows fast and easy purification of the protein and examine folding status by e.g. circular dichroism -LRB- or NMR if available -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB-.
We expect that the predictive power of the structure filter can be improved as more data becomes available.
For example, one might devise a procedure trained on the structural data of specific motifs and qualified to make predictions only for those motifs.
We investigated this approach and concluded that it would currently be applicable only to the very few LMs that have enough instances in the database.
For the great majority of LMs, appropriate training and tests can not be carried out and predictions turned out to be unacceptably stringent : An effective procedure should be based on many more instances per LM and these are not available at the moment.
We believe that in the future, as an increasing number of protein structures become available and the quantity of ELM annotation data grows, it will be possible to appropriately train and test motif-specific structure filters for a significant number of LMs.
Whenever a query can be modelled on a structure, the structure filter can help in discriminating true from false positive matches of LMs.
As a consequence, the structure filter, which can be considered to all intents and purposes as a precursor in the use of structural information for short LM false positive discrimination, is going to become increasingly indispensable for the ELM resource 's filtering framework in the structural genomics era.
This approach may result, for example, in the organism of the reference structure being different from the source organism of the user query sequence.
It can be observed that mouseover of the known sumoylation site reveals that it scores in the enriched bin and receives a significant p-value : if we did not already know it was a true motif, it would be an attractive candidate for experimental testing.
While in principle RICs can be generated using the first two calls, we believe that ubiquitous use of the RIC operation in proteomics data analysis justifies exposure of RIC extraction as a primitive in the API.
We propose that a proprietary file format is considered mzAPI compliant when the manufacturer provides a freely available, and preferably redistributable, implementation of the aforementioned 5 core procedures, or an extended version that may evolve from a community-driven standardization effort.
Naturally, additional procedure calls, such as charge state or signal-to-noise values for each isotope cluster in MS or MS/MS scans, can be incorporated into the mzAPI framework by essentially subclassing the core mzFile class.
The performance of the common API could be further improved by implementation in C++ or C#, but we explicitly chose Python to maintain maximum flexibility through user defined scripts -LRB- see below -RRB-.
Regardless of native file type, the use of a common API eliminates the need for storage and tracking of surrogate files ; based on previous reports, this can be particularly problematic for full profile data files, which can grow significantly in size upon conversion to XML -LSB- 9 -RSB-.
Generation of RICs is perhaps the best example of a data slice procedure supported by all manufacturer data systems.
This result supports the notion that pragmatic data access patterns are well supported by existing, albeit proprietary, manufacturer libraries, and more importantly, that these libraries can be efficiently utilized through a common and redistributable API.
Users with full access to the Mascot server may parse results directly from the. DAT file using. mz scripts -LRB- multiplierz reports and. mz scripts and described below -RRB-.
For example, high-confidence peptide identifications may be used for direct generation of RICs across user-defined time and mass-to-charge ranges.
We take advantage of Excel 's ability to store images in the worksheet -LRB- as comments -RRB-, thereby creating an information-rich, yet portable, report that may be readily formatted to meet specific scientific journal data submission requirements -LSB- 19 -RSB-.
In addition, users may adjust the time or m/z range displayed in each data window.
Users may export publication quality images from all Scrapbook plots.
A typical strategy would be to simply adjust experimental conditions to yield a maximum number of phosphotyrosine sites subsequent to LC-MS/MS and database search.
However, given the acutely low levels of tyrosine phosphorylation in embryonic stem cells, we chose instead to gauge enrichment efficiency based on the relative fraction of MS/MS scans that contained a phosphotyrosine immonium ion -LRB- m/z = 216.04 -RRB- -LSB- 21,22 -RSB-, irrespective of any putative peptide sequence assignment.
The intensity distributions for phosphopeptides assigned uniquely to either metal oxide did not differ significantly from the intensity distributions for commonly detected phosphopeptides, indicating that the unique precursors were not confined to low signal-to-noise regions.
We speculated that the presence of multiple isotope peaks per fragment ion in the high resolution Orbitrap MS/MS scans may degrade the sensitivity of the search algorithm, resulting in fewer high-confidence sequence assignments.
A variety of parameters can be used to adjust the stringency of spectrum filtering such as maximum charge state, minimum fragment ion mass-to-charge ratio, as well as an option to remove any precursor signal that may remain in the MS/MS spectrum.
Relative protein quantitation can be achieved via a label-free approach whereby tryptic digests of protein samples are analyzed without incorporation of stable isotope labels ; the resulting peak intensities -LRB- or areas -RRB- for the constituent peptides are combined and compared across samples as well as within replicates -LSB- 26 -RSB-.
Users may also generate associated graphs using native plotting capabilities in Excel.
The measured mass errors may be used as input for mass tolerance parameters in subsequent database search algorithms -LRB- e.g., Mascot, SEQUEST, X!Tandem, etc. -RRB- for peptide sequence identification.
We note however, that the two strategies are not mutually exclusive ; that is, support for mzXML -LSB- 9 -RSB-, or the recently described mzML -LSB- 29 -RSB- can be readily incorporated into mzAPI.
Similarly, output from multiplierz can be readily formatted in pepXML -LSB- 12 -RSB-.
In addition, recent discussions focused on data sharing in proteomics suggest that standards may evolve beyond XML-based formats -LSB- 30,31 -RSB-.
Equally important, the emergence of translation layers such as cygwin -LSB- 32 -RSB- and Wine -LSB- 33 -RSB-, continue to blur inter-platform boundaries, such that software solutions amenable to the widest audience may eclipse those based largely on platform independence.
Similar image-enhanced spreadsheets may be generated in open formats such as OpenOffice.org XML -LSB- 34 -RSB- -LRB- see Additional File 4 -RRB-, but our experience to date indicates that the majority of biomedical researchers still opt for commercial spreadsheet solutions, either out of familiarity or because of existing institutional support.
In particular, incorporation of mzAPI into the multiplierz desktop architecture may offer a better impedance match between the rate of proprietary mass spectrometry innovation and researchers' demands for increased autonomy in their data analysis tasks.
Evaluation results indicated that our method outperforms sequence-profile approaches, and had comparable performance to that of structure-based methods on these benchmarks.
We believe that this server is useful in structure prediction and modeling, especially in detecting homologous templates with sequence similarity in the twilight zone.
For template-based modeling -LRB- TBM -RRB- and fold recognition methods, a prediction model can be built based on the coordinates of the appropriate template -LRB- s -RRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB-.
These approaches generally involve four steps : 1 -RRB- a representative protein structure database is searched to identify a template that is structurally similar to the protein target ; 2 -RRB- an alignment between the target and the template is generated that should align equivalent residues together as in the case of a structural alignment ; 3 -RRB- a prediction structure of the target is built based on the alignment and the selected template structure, and 4 -RRB- model quality evaluation.
The S2A2 is a 60 × 60 matrix that considers all possible pair combination of 20 amino acid types and three secondary structure elements.
These results demonstrate that the RS letters with the S2A2 matrix may be able to more accurately find remote homologous sequences than simple amino acid sequence analyses.
The target is the BIG_1156 .2 domain of putative penicillin-binding protein MrcA from Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718.
The alignment and predicted structure of the BIG_1156 .2 domain of putative penicillin-binding protein MrcA from Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 using the -LRB- PS -RRB- 2-v2 server.
We believe that this server is useful in protein structure prediction and modeling, especially in detecting homologous templates with sequence similarity in the twilight zone.
